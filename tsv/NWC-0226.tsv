| Two trains can use the Up Banbury Loop simultaneously - the first train to arrive must draw forward to signal       |    |
| OL7120. For planning purposes this is shown as Banbury Platform 4. The maximum standage at this signal is 815       |    |
| meters or 127 SLUs to the overlap of signal OL7134 (this excludes locomotive(s) and stand-back allowance). The      |    |
| maximum standage at signal OL7134 (clear of Reservoir Jn) is 823 meters or 128 SLUs (this excludes                  |    |
| locomotive(s) and stand-back allowance).                                                                            |    |

| Planning Restriction                                                                                                |    |
| The maximum standage at signal OL7129 on the Down Banbury Loop (clear of Banbury South Jn) is 815                   |    |
| meters/127 SLUs or (clear of signal OL9128) 582 meters/91 SLUs (this excludes locomotive(s) and stand-back          |    |
| allowance).  For planning purposes this is shown as Banbury Platform 1. If a train is required to stop at the Down  |    |
| Banbury Loop for crew change purposes this must be done in Platform 1 and consideration must be given to            |    |
| whether the rear of the train fouls Banbury Depot Jn. Once a crew stop has been completed, the train can pull       |    |
| forward to OL7129 to be clear of Banbury Depot Jn.                                                                  |    |

| After a freight train has arrived in the Down Banbury Goods loop from the Fenny Compton direction, its              |    |
| locomotive(s) will run round its train via Signal OL7129. This can happen even if platform 1 at Banbury is occupied |    |
| but note that once a movement has been signaled towards OL7129 from the south or towards OL9128 form the            |    |
| north, a time-out of 2 minutes will be necessary before another movement can take place once either axle counter    |    |
| section between the two signals has been occupied.                                                                  |    |

| Trains to Banbury Aggregate Sidings less than 320m/50SLU can propel into the Sidings from the Banbury               |    |
| Reservoir Neck without fouling the route to/from the Down Banbury Goods Loop.  Trains over 320m/50SLU will be       |    |
| split on the Down Banbury Goods Loop. Please see rules for Banbury Aggregate Sidings for timings regarding          |    |
| splitting trains on the Down Banbury Goods Loop.                                                                    |    |
