| Platforms 4 and 5: It is prohibited for two class 80x units to attach, detach or platform-share in platform 4 and 5 at  |
| Paddington due to insufficient length and SPAD risk.                                                                    |

| Stabling of trains at Royal Oak has not been practiced for several years, due to environmental complaints from the      |
| local authority.  In view of the sensitivity of the noise pollution issue, the planned use of Royal Oak for stabling of |
| trains is considered most undesirable. Any Train Operator considering such use must, therefore, consult with            |
| Network Rail before submitting a bid. Royal Oak Sidings are available in an emergency, subject to driver                |
| compliance with noise abatement, as detailed in the Sectional Appendix. This does not apply to electric trains. Bi      |
| mode trains must be AC mode only.                                                                                       |
