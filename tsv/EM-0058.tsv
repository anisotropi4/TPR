| For any trains arriving on the Down Slow via a shunt move, the controller on site must obtain permission from the     |
| signaller to occupy the Up Slow so a radio can be safely passed to the driver to perform a radio test. The train will |
| then draw clear of Limbury North GF.                                                                                  |

| For any trains arriving on the Up Slow, the driver must pick up a radio from the controller on site and, after a      |
| satisfactory radio test, draw forward clear of Limbury South GF. Please note it is not possible to access the sidings |
| directly from the Up Slow.                                                                                            |
