| There is no route into Mountsorrel Sidings in the Up direction.  Trains from Loughborough or beyond destined for           |
| Mountsorrel Sidings must go to Leicester Humberstone Road sidings to run-round.                                            |
| There is only one reception siding available for arriving trains.  After the arrival of a train onto the reception road it |
| is necessary for the arriving train to draw forward before propelling back into one of the sidings.  Until this is         |
| complete a second train cannot arrive onto the reception siding.  Therefore, trains must be planned to arrive 20           |
| minutes apart. When the preceding train is a light engine the train following can arrive 5 minutes after the light         |
| engine.  To achieve this, it might be necessary to time arriving trains to wait at Humberstone Road Junction or            |
| Melton Mowbray Down Goods Loop.                                                                                            |
| Trains can depart from Mountsorrel in either the Up or Down direction.  Up direction trains use the Down Fast line         |
| in the Up direction as far as Sileby Junction.  See Sileby Junction for margin information.                                |
| Departing trains must be planned at least 15 minutes apart when leaving Mountsorrel.                                       |
| This is due to the need for shunting to take place within the terminal.                                                    |
