| In the Down direction, Arcow Quarry Ground Frame (GF) does not split up the section Settle Jn to Horton-in-      |
| Ribblesdale; therefore:                                                                                          |
|                                                                                                                  |
| When a train for Arcow Quarry arrives at Arcow Quarry GF, the minimum interval to be allowed before the next     |
| Down train passes Settle Jn is 12 minutes. This is to allow sufficient time for the train at the GF to clear the |
| mainline and for the GF to be given back to the signaller at Settle Jn.                                          |
|                                                                                                                  |
| Once a train has departed/passed Horton-in-Ribblesdale, the next train can depart/pass Arcow Quarry GF 2         |
| minutes later.                                                                                                   |
