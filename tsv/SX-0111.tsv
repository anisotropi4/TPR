| Pathing time or other allowances should not exceed 1 minute for trains up to 164 metres in length. Trains longer |
| than 164 metres should be planned without pathing time between Windmill Bridge Junction and Norwood Fork         |
| Junction. A planned stop at either Norwood Fork Junction or Windmill Bridge Junction where pathing time or       |
| allowances would otherwise exceed 1 minute is inappropriate given the congested nature of the network at this    |
| point.                                                                                                           |
| Pathing time or other allowances must not be placed between Gloucester Road Junction and Norwood Fork            |
| Junction in the Up direction due to the risk of trains standing at signal T24 fouling Gloucester Road Junction   |

| A train exceeding 153m/24SLU in length will foul Selhurst Junction when standing at T73 on the Down Selhurst     |
| Spur                                                                                                             |
| Therefore, junction margins must be based on trainsâ€™ departure time at Gloucester Road Junction                  |
