| When a train departing Stewarts Lane T&R.S.M.D bound for London Victoria (Central) follows another train on the     |
| Battersea Reversible towards Battersea Pier Junction, it cannot pass or arrive at Stewarts Lane Junction until 31⁄2 |
| minutes after the preceding train has passed Battersea Pier Junction due to only 1 signal (Signal VC546) in the     |
| section. This restriction also applies if the second train is reversing at Stewarts Lane Junction Shunt Signal 571  |
| beyond VS735 points on the Battersea Reversible, which is the only available signal when formed of rolling stock    |
| that does not permit the driver to walk through the train                                                           |
