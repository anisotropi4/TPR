| Permissive moves are allowed for freight trains on the Independent Lines independents. A 2nd train can be               |
| permissively routed onto the same Independent Line at Crewe Signal NH34/36 with the 2nd train stopping at               |
| BH29/30 then advancing forward to NH34/36 once the previous train has cleared the section. A 4 minute                   |
| headway can be applied to services being planned permissively at NH34/36. A 4 minute headway must be                    |
| applied at Basford Hall Jn and Crewe Signal NH34/36.                                                                    |

| A 10 minute OP stop is required for all trains routed through on the Up Through Siding at Basford Hall Up Through       |
| Siding Stop Board to allow the driver to contact the Freightliner PIC (Person in Charge) for authority to proceed.      |

| A Train of 556m (87 SLU) can be held without fouling the junction at Crewe S.S.N SB.                                    |
| Anything over 556m will block access to Crewe Basford Hall Yard (Freightliner) from both the Up Fast                    |
| Independent and Up Slow Independent lines and obstruct moves to/from Crewe South Yard Bypass line. Any                  |
| conflict with a train of 556m or greater will have the margin applied based on the departure time of the first train    |
| from Basford Hall Up Through Siding Stop Board                                                                          |

| Due to non-electrified infrastructure at the south end of Crewe Basford Hall Yard (Freightliner), all electric traction |
| must arrive via the north end of the yard via Crewe Sorting Sidings North SB on the Down Independent Lines and          |
| propel into the yard.                                                                                                   |

| A down train arriving at Crewe Basford Hall Yard (Freightliner) directly from Crewe Basford Hall Jn is limited to       |
| 595m (93 SLU). Any down train greater than 595m will overhang the junction in the rear and block access to the          |
| main yard from the south, thus any conflicting moves will be based upon the first trains departure time from Crewe      |
| Basford Hall Yard.                                                                                                      |
