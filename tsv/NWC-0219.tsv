| Barr West Jn.  This means that before a train in excess of 34 SLUs in length can depart Perry Barr North Jn        |                                     |        |

| Barr North Jn on the Up Grand line.  Therefore, when timing a train in excess of 34 SLUs in length from Bescot or  |                                     |        |
