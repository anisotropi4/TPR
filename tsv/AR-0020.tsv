| Activity Codes – Notes                                                                                               |
| 1. Any passenger train that stops at a location automatically generates a T Activity unless it is suppressed.        |
| 2. If an activity is required that removes the ‘passenger stop’ activity (T, D, U and R) from TPS, then the          |
| ‘passenger stop’ activity must always appear in the first activity field (e.g. T -D would be correct, -D T would     |
| not).  This is because the National Rail Timetable (NRT) extract program only considers the first activity field.    |
| If it does not find a ‘passenger stop’ activity in the first field the time will not be extracted to appear in the   |
| NRT.                                                                                                                 |
| 3. Up to 6 activities may be shown for each event.                                                                   |
| 4. No two activities may be duplicated at the same event.                                                            |
| 5. At any one event, the following groups are mutually exclusive:                                                    |
| a) D, U, T, N, S, TW, OP.                                                                                            |
| b) -D, -U, -T.                                                                                                       |
| c) TB, TF.                                                                                                           |
| d) KC, KE.                                                                                                           |
| 6. N, R, G, D and U are only valid with Train Categories XC, XD, XI, XX, XZ, OO, OW, OL, BS, BR and blank            |
| (i.e. 'advertised' services). R, D and U are additionally valid with Train Categories XU and OU (unadvertised        |
| services).                                                                                                           |
| 7. K, KC, KE, KF, KS are only valid with Train Categories starting X or O.                                           |
| 8. If TF is present then none of K, KC, KE, KF, KS can be present.                                                   |
| 9. Activity T indicates that a train stops to pick up and set down.  This normally refers to passengers.  Activity   |
| -T indicates that the train stops to attach and detach vehicles.  At any location where a 'stop' time is shown,      |
| TPS or a similar system will assume a default activity is required unless otherwise specified.  These default        |
| activities are as follows: T for trains with a Train Category starting in X or O, OP for trains with a Train         |
| Category starting in Z or E, and -T for all other trains (but see below).  The default activity will be generated    |
| when the upload file is created.                                                                                     |
| 10. If activities U, D, N, R, OP, S, TW, -U or -D are specified then this overrides the defaults and only the        |
| specified activities will be included in the upload file (it is not necessary to use the * suppression code if       |
| these codes are present).                                                                                            |
| 11. If a traffic activity is NOT required at a 'stop' location with activities other than U, D, N, R, OP, S, TW, -U  |
| or -D  (e.g. at 'C' or 'L' stops) then the * must be input to the TPS or similar system train specification at that  |
| location to suppress -T or T.  If the * is not added to indicate a non-traffic stop then T, -T or OP will be added   |
| to the upload file.                                                                                                  |
| 12. If an activity -T (only) is required on a train with a Category starting in X or O it is necessary to add a * to |
| the TPS spec (to suppress ‘T’) and positively show -T in the activity column.                                        |
