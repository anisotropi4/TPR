Restrictions			
"Simultaneous arrivals at the Stabling Lines are not possible. This includes both the Stabling Lines and ShuntSpur, e.g. if one arrival is at the London End and one arrival is at the Shunt Spur at the Country End. This is dueto the signal overlaps on the Stabling Lines extending into the Shunt Spur at the Country End and overrun spur atthe London End. Similarly, a simultaneous departure from the Shunt Spur and arrival at the Stabling Lines is notpossible."
