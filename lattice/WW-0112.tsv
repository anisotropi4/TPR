Royal Oak Sidings, Paddington
ARS assumes Siding 1 for up trains if vacant
"Stabling of trains at Royal Oak has not been practiced for several years, due to environmental complaints from thelocal authority.  In view of the sensitivity of the noise pollution issue, the planned use of Royal Oak for stabling oftrains is considered most undesirable. Any Train Operator considering such use must, therefore, consult withNetwork Rail before submitting a bid. Royal Oak Sidings are available in an emergency, subject to drivercompliance with noise abatement, as detailed in the Sectional Appendix. This does not apply to electric trains. Bimode trains must be AC mode only."
