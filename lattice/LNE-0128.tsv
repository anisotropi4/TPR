"#Where the first train is an express service timed at 100mph or above, the converging margin here should takeprecedence over the headway i.e. no pathing time should be applied to the second train between Digswell andWoolmer Green Junction for the purpose of artificially re-establishing a higher headway value than the margingiven; the headway of 3 minutes should naturally restore itself once the appropriate acceleration allowances areadded to the schedule of the second train"
