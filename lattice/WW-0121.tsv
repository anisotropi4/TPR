Planning Note		
"It is not possible to add timing allowances between Maidenhead East Jn and Maidenhead as there are nointermediate signals, though {1} for permissive platform arrivals remains required. If an engineering allowance isrequired in a Down train approaching Maidenhead (see Section 5.5), and the train is also timed at MaidenheadEast Jn, then the allowance should instead be applied at Maidenhead East Jn."
