Station Working Requirements			
"The following principles should be observed when compiling Platform arrangements at Waterloo. Theseprinciples are for guidance and are not factors that will determine the validity of an Operator accessproposal.It may be possible on a limited number of occasions for a departing Main Fast service to run down the UpMain Relief Line, and cross behind the arrival, or a departing Main Slow service to run Down Main Fast toWest Crossings if the arrival is on the Up Main Slow. Under these circumstances, attention is drawn to therelevant junction margin value.For amended timetable purposes, to avoid a number of re-timings, it is permissible to have a limited numberof ‘same arrival and departing time’ workings in conflicting Platforms. Each occasion must be individuallyagreed with Network Rail’s Amended Timetable Manager. This is not to be taken as a general exception tothe normal junction margins as stated above.Trains formed of Class 455 Units may be programmed to detach: -•In any Platform (subject to route restrictions) provided that the jumpers are connected on the Platformside.•In Platforms 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 16 and 17 (which are equipped with off-side ramps) irrespective of which sidethe jumpers are connectedDown passenger services should not normally be retimed from Waterloo to accommodate an additional orretimed incoming service.Stock must be out-berthed from Platforms under engineers’ possession unless special dispensation isgiven.For further information regarding Platform availability please see the Sectional Appendix; Section3B"
