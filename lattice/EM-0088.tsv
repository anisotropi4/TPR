Planning Note		
"Down direction (Eastbound)A train exceeding 200m in length will foul Mansfield Junction when pathing time is applied between MansfieldJunction and Nottingham. Therefore, junction margins must be based on trains’ arrival/pass time at Nottingham.Up direction (Westbound)A train exceeding 200m in length will foul Nottingham West Junction if held at Mansfield Junction or when pathingtime is applied between Nottingham and Mansfield Junction. Therefore, junction margins must be based on trains’pass/departure time at Mansfield Junction."
