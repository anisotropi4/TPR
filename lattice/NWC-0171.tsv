Brake Testing														
"Great Western Railway Class 80x services require a {1⁄2} minute running brake test allowance to be included ineach schedule timed using 802-E or 802-D timing loads, at the first practical opportunity that a running speed of40mph or higher is achievable, or prior to the first stop (whichever occurs first.) This is a mandatory allowance, toapply at the start of each journey, after any driver change, change to train formation or any reversal en-route. It isnot to be applied during local shunt moves or ECS moves on/off depots. Where doubt exists, please requestadvice from the Train Operator."
