""	"Please note – While a Class 80x formed of 9/10 cars is standing in Saltash Platform 1, the junction in rear isfouled and the AB section from St Budeaux Ferry Road remains occupied.  It is not possible for an Up train todepart or pass Saltash or a following Down train to enter the single line section until after the train in question hasdeparted Saltash.An Up train approaching Saltash under cautionary aspects is already braking for the 15mph permanent speedrestriction and therefore the normal SRTs are not compromised."
