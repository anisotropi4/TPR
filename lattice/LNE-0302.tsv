Shipley		
"Due to the positioning of Stop Boards, the following apply to LNER trains running to/from Bradford Forster Square.•All LNER passenger trains to/from Bradford Forster Square must use platform 3 when calling.•Passenger trains towards Leeds formed of Class 91 + nine Mark IV  stop beyond signal L3966 whencalling therefore no conflicting train movements should be planned through Shipley East Junction andDockfield Jn. Platform 3W cannot be used as a workaround for this, Platform 3x must be used for Class91+ nine Mark IV. Additional detail and the junction margin can be found on the Dockfield Junction entry.•Trains towards Leeds formed of 9 or 10 car Class 80X will block Shipley South Jn while calling. Seejunction margins"
