Planning Restriction	
"No pathing time should be applied for any train over 200m in length approaching St Pancras International as anysuch train held at Signals TWH200 or TWH198 will lock the preceding crossover between Churchyard Sidings andthe Up & Down Slow. There is then a risk of a stand-off between any train held at Signal TWH200 and any traindeparting Platforms 3 or 4 via the Down Fast and routed towards the Down Slow; or between any train held atSignal TWH198 and any train departing Platforms 1-3 via the Up Fast and routed towards the Down Slow."
