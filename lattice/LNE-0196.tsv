Restrictions		
"•A down train longer than 178m arriving into Platforms 3/4 will foul the route to and from South Hylton. Thistrain cannot turn round in the platform and return south and must depart towards Newcastle at least 11⁄2minutes before the next Metro departs towards South Hylton.•A down train longer than 195m can only arrive into Platforms 1/2 by prior agreement between the Trainoperator and the Local Operations Manager. The rear of the train will ‘lock’ the crossovers at the south end ofthe station, preventing moves to/from other platforms.•Metro trains can only use No. 2 Siding; No. 1 Siding is not electrified"
