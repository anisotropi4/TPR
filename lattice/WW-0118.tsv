Signalling Limitations			
"It is not possible to add pathing time to trains timed at Hayes and Harlington between Heathrow Airport Jn andHayes and Harlington (both directions) as there are no intermediate signals.Where the leading train calls at Hayes and Harlington, the headway margin is offset, applying between departureof the leading train from Hayes and Harlington and following train at Heathrow Airport Jn, as yellow signals will beshown at Heathrow Airport Jn till Hayes and Harlington is clear.Where a train is planned from Heathrow Airport to run ahead of a train from Slough direction and both booked viaML, any pathing should be applied to the second train approaching Heathrow Airport Jn and not at Stockley Jn.This is due to ARS requirements."
