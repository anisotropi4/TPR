"P = Parallel move; H = a following move on headway (6 minutes for LN740/742); —* = a following move in the same direction with differential value detailed; n/a = Move not applicable, one train working in terminal;†= With the exception of LD moves, all trains destined for Simon Storage West are required to perform a run round on the Western Jetty Arrivals line and propel into the terminal. This requires the use of the DownKillingholme Line."
