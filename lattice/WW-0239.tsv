The Down train should arrive no less than 4 minutes before the Up train is due.The Down train will then have to wait for the driver of the Up train to hand in the token and for the signaller todeliver the token to the Down train.  The minimum dwell time is the time difference between the arrival of theDown train and the departure from Whitland of the Up train plus 5 minutes for the token delivery."
