Planning Notes		
"Sundon Loop is not electrified and therefore cannot be used by electric trains.There is an intermediate signal and it is therefore possible to accommodate two trains in Sundon Loop – themaximum standage in the southern section (to Signal WH518) is 274 SLU/1756 metres and the maximumstandage in the northern section (to Signal WH522) is 94 SLU/602 metres."
