SC145 FORT WILLIAM TO MALLAIG		
""		
"General RestrictionAt all Token Exchange Points where a token exchange has to be carried out, a minimum dwell of 1 minute isrequired. At a number of TEPs along this route, it is possible to receive a Long Section Token, allowing the train totraverse the next two sections without an intermediate token exchange stop. A Long Section Token can only beissued if both sections are clear.The whole RETB area north of Helensburgh Upper is under the control of two consoles at Banavie PSB, covering(a) Helensburgh Upper to Oban, and (b) Upper Tyndrum to Mallaig. Therefore token exchanges within each areacannot take place simultaneously.  Arrivals at any two separate locations within the same console area must be aminimum of 1 minute apart.  However, trains passing at the same location can take place as shown below:-"
