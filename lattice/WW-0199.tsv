""	"A Down train from any route cannot pass/arrive Patchway platform 2 while an Up conflicting move is stopped atPatchway platform 1. This is due to junction signal BL1536 being positioned in rear of Patchway platform 1. If theDown train is routed first, the above Signalling Restriction applies to the Up train.Trains from Filton West Jn must not have pathing time or stops added approaching Patchway, this should beadded approaching Filton West Jn instead.  Signal BL1834 (approaching Single Line Jn) cannot be cleared untilBL2046 (protecting Patchway Junction No.1) is cleared, this is due to the risk of trains rolling back over ‘Filton TipAOCL’."
