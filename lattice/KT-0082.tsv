""	"All the additional allowances referred to in this section must be explicitly identified in the Working Timetable and onno account may they be consolidated into the basic point to point timing. It is essential to the efficient operation ofthe automatic route setting equipment as installed at Ashford Integrated Electronic Control Centre (IECC) thatallowances are separated this way.Where a pathing allowance is required for a train that would also be provided with a performance allowance, theperformance allowance may be consolidated into the pathing allowance except where mandated by TimetablePlanning Rules. However, engineering allowances mandated by Timetable Planning Rules must be keptcompletely separate from and, where appropriate, additional to any other form of allowance."
