Planning Restrictions		
"Maximum Standage in Platforms 1, 2 and 3 is 261m (40 SLUs).Any trains planned to stop in Bedford station that are longer than the maximum standage length will lock thepreceding block section and routes into and out of adjacent platforms. In this instance, relevant junction marginsshould be applied from when the train departs and clears the points rather than when it arrives into the stationplatform.GTR services must not be planned into Platform 4 as GTR train drivers do not possess the necessary routeknowledge to perform a shunt move via Bedford North Junction to Platforms 1-3"

Planning Note		
"No timing allowances should be applied between Bedford and Bedford North Junction as there are no intermediatesignals"
