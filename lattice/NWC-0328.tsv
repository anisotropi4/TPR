""	Planning Notes		
""	"An 11-car Pendolino (or train of an equivalent length) which has arrived in Platform 1 via the Up Fast will foul thetrack circuit in rear preventing a route being set into Platform 2 from the Up Fast. The following service must beheld at Heaton Norris Jn until the train in Platform 1 has departed."		
""	"The maximum standage between Stockport and Edgeley Jn No.2 on the Down Slow or Fast is 80 meters/12.5SLU. This will permit a route to be set from the Up Fast to the Down Liverpool at Edgeley Jn No.2 but blocks theroute from the Up Liverpool to the Down Fast."		
""	"Trains in the Up direction must depart Stockport on the FL if routed towards Cheadle Village Jn at Edgeley JnNo.2 SB."		
""	"Whilst a train is being shunted at the north end of Stockport station Up Slow to Down Fast, or Down Fast to UpSlow or Up Fast, a train cannot pass Heaton Norris Jn on the Up Fast."
