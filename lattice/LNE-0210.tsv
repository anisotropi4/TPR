""	"Restrictions:•Trains arriving from either direction can only be planned into the platform and NOT directly into the RunRound loop•Due to the operation of two Ground Frames, any run round must be allowed a minimum of 30 minutes.When the locomotive is moving from the run round loop onto the east end of the train, the driver must bein possession of the token for either the Glaisdale or Nunthorpe section; planners must satisfy themselvesthat there are no trains moving in either direction on the relevant section"		
""	"Notes:•Trains crossing at Battersby occupy the same section of track and platform and must have 5 minutesbetween consecutive arrivals and departures due to TPWS requirements•Trains passing do so by utilizing the permissive working on the platform line. Planners must satisfythemselves of the lengths of both trains, and that they both can be accommodated according to theplatform length AND the distances quoted below•Platform and runround loop, stop board to stop board = 175m•Buffer stops to east end stop board = 325m"
