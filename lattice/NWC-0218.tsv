""	"RestrictionThere is limited standage between Perry Barr North Jn and Perry Barry West Jn on the Up Soho line.Consequently, it is not possible to stand a train in excess of 34 SLUs/218 metres in length at NS279 signal, PerryBarr West Jn.  This means that before a train in excess of 34 SLUs in length can depart Perry Barr North Jntowards Soho, the route must be available through to Soho East Jn.  If the route is not available, a train from theBescot direction in excess of 34 SLUs will stand at NS272 at Perry Barr North Jn on the Up Grand line.  Therefore,when timing a train in excess of 34 SLUs in length from Bescot or beyond through Perry Barr North and WestJunctions towards Soho you must be aware of movements through Perry West Jn and plan accordingly so as toavoid problems at Perry Barr North Jn."
