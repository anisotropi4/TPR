Copenhagen Junction		
""		
"Note:  Trains in the Down direction on the North London Incline (NLI) should not normally be shown to stop atCopenhagen Junction.  Down trains required to stop on the NLI to wait a path over Copenhagen Jn should betimed to stop at York Way North Jn unless they exceed 630 metres in length.  Only trains in excess of 630 metresin length should be timed to stop at Copenhagen Jn.  In those circumstances due to signalling constraints thefollowing applies:  A Down train on the NLI planned to stop at Copenhagen Jn must arrive a minimum of 5 minutesbefore the passage of any train on the Down Slow"
