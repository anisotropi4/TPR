A train up to 109SLU/698m can depart only from FLT via Trafford ParkWest Jn to avoid conflict. The junction margins for Trafford Park East Jn should be applied to these moves.If an Up train in excess of 109SLU/698m is occupying the Football Ground Halt, a train to the Euroterminal can berouted via Trafford Park West Jn to avoid conflict. The junction margins for Trafford Park East Jn should beapplied to these moves."
