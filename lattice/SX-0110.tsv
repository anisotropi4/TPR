Planning Note				
"Empty stock workings from London Bridge or London Victoria should, whenever possible, be timed to run viaPeckham Rye (if from London Bridge), Streatham Common and Selhurst to minimise conflicting movements atNorwood Junction.Trains timed to run from London Bridge or London Victoria to Selhurst Depot via Norwood Junction should include“dot” stop at Norwood Junction to minimise the margins required to avoid conflicting movements with trains runningin the opposite direction."				
"The non-stop headway applies for consecutive departures from Norwood Junction providing the second train uses adifferent platform and the correct headway is applied at the next timing point irrespective of calling pattern. NationalTPR section 1.5.5 Application of Planning Headways refers."
