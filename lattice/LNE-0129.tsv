"#Where the first train is an express service timed at 100mph or above, the converging margin here should takeprecedence over the headway i.e. no pathing time should be applied to the second train between Woolmer GreenJunction and Welwyn Garden City for the purpose of artificially re-establishing a higher headway value than themargin given; the general headway of 3 minutes should naturally restore itself by Potters Bar."

Planning Note			
Where possible, pathing allowances should not be applied between Woolmer Green and Digswell
