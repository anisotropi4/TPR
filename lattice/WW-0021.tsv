Activity Codes – Notes
1. Any passenger train that stops at a location automatically generates a T Activity unless it is suppressed.
"2. If an Activity is required that removes the ‘passenger stop’ Activity (T, D, U and R), then the ‘passengerstop’ Activity must always appear in the first Activity field (e.g. T –D would be correct, –D T would not).  Thisis because the National Rail Timetable (NRT) extract program only considers the first Activity field.  If it doesnot find a ‘passenger stop’ Activity in the first field the time will not be extracted to appear in the NRT."
3. Up to 6 Activities may be shown for each event.
4. No two Activities may be duplicated at the same event.
"At any one event, the following groups are mutually exclusive:a) D, U, T, N, S, TW, OP.b) –D, –U, –T.c) TB, TF.d) KC, KE."
"6. N, R, G, D and U are only valid with Train Categories XC, XD, XI, XX, XZ, OO, OW, OL, BS, BR and blank(i.e. 'advertised' services). R, D and U are additionally valid with Train Categories XU and OU (unadvertisedservices)."
7. K, KC, KE, KF, KS are only valid with Train Categories starting X or O.
8. If TF is present then none of K, KC, KE, KF, KS can be present.
"9. Activity T indicates that a train stops to pick up and set down.  This normally refers to passengers.  Activity–T indicates that the train stops to attach and detach vehicles.  At any location where a 'stop' time is shown,TPS or a similar system will assume a default Activity is required unless otherwise specified.  These defaultActivities are as follows: T for trains with a Train Category starting in X or O, OP for trains with a TrainCategory starting in Z or E, and –T for all other trains (but see below).  The default Activity will be generatedwhen the upload file is created."
"10. If Activities U, D, N, R, OP, S, TW, –U or –D are specified then this overrides the defaults and only thespecified Activities will be included in the upload file."
