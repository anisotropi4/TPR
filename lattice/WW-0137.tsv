""	Normal platform usage or guidance (shown by arrival)					
""						
""	"Wherever possible, through trains should be timed into the far platform, and reversing trains should be timed intothe near platform. The exception to this principle is through trains arriving in the down direction into Platforms 3/4,which should be timed into Platform 3 to avoid passengers having to walk back to the gates from Platform 4."					
""						
""	"When units are required to attach, involving a movement past a Platform Sharing Signal to the far platform, aminimum station dwell of 5 minutes must be applied to the second train. This incorporates the track sectionoccupancy of 2 minutes required by the interlocking, for the Platform Sharing Signal (position light) to clear, and anattaching allowance of 3 minutes.Prior to submitting a bid Train Operators are requested to discuss with their Network Rail Business Manager anyservice (i) with a proposed platform occupation time of longer than 15 minutes beyond the specified minimumTurnround allowance time and/or (ii) which requires attaching and/or detaching of locomotive(s)."
