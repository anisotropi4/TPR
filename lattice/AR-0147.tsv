"Operating RestrictionsWhen not crossing another train (ie passing or being passed by another train), trains normally use Platform 1 ineither direction (Up & Down Ockendon).Down stopping passenger services should be routed via Platform 1 where possible. Should no other timetablingsolution be available, the planner must inform the TOC that Platform 2 is being used. This is due to there being noDOO equipment at the country end of Platform 2, requiring dispatch staff to be provided.Crossing trains cannot arrive from opposite directions simultaneously; trains must arrive at least 2 minutes apart.A train exceeding 312 metres / 48 SLU (down direction) or 484 metres / 75 SLU (up direction) may pass anothertrain. The second train must not exceed these lengths."
