"Restriction:Up train on Up line – Additional requirements associated with train lengths.If it is necessary for a train with a length of more than 450 yards (420 metres) to pass over the crossing in the Updirection on the Up Bridlington line, the crossing must be under local control and the attendant advised in sufficienttime before the train approaches the crossingReason for restriction:-Signal SR124 at the west end of Hunmanby Station is designed not to clear to a proceed aspect until a train hascome to a stand at it.  The design of the crossing means there is a possibility that the barriers will raise and thelights extinguish before a train with a length of more than 450 yards (420 metres) has passed clear of thecrossing.  Therefore, when such trains are planned to run over this route, arrangements must be made in advancefor the crossing to be placed under local control"
