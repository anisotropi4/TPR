Pathing Rule															
"Where pathing time of more than 2 minutes is unavoidably imposed between stopping points due to conflict at ajunction a restart allowance must be inserted in the timing section after the conflict point as shown in the table below.Note:- Pathing time must not be applied approaching ARS controlled junctions where a restart allowance would beincurred as it will be ignored by ARS. This causes the route to be set too early creating delay to any preceding trainplanned ahead on minimum junction margin. Any pathing required should be inserted at the preceding dwell point."
