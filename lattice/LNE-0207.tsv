"Restrictions•When a run–round is taking place at Grangetown no other train should be timed on the Goods Linesbetween South Bank and Grangetown Junction.•Following a pass from Tees Dock no train may pass South Bank to the Goods Line until the train fromTees Dock has passed South Bank. This is due to overlap constraints. There is an exception for trains inthe Down under 573 meters which can be planned to stop at Signal G727 to allow a train from Tees dockto pass Grangetown towards South Bank. In addition Light Locos from Tees Dock can stop at G710  toallow a pass from South Bank to the down goods."
