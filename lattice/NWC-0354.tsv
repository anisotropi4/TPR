""	Newton Heath TMD
""	
""	Planning Note
""	"Trains arriving onto Newton Heath TMD arrive onto one of two fuel roads, each capable of taking up to sixvehicles. A train can follow another onto the same fuel road, but once the road is full the units have to be fuelledand move forward onto the depot before a further arrival onto that road. A train can be arriving onto the secondfuel road whilst units are being fuelled on the first road. This means that different permutations of rates of arrivalare possible, depending on the number and length of vehicles on each arrival and the spacing between arrivals. Itis also possible for an arrival to be formed of eight vehicles, though this requires a longer gap behind the arrivaldue to the time taken to accept the train onto the depot.If, for validation reasons, it is necessary to significantly retime an arrival onto Newton Heath from the path which isbid, contact should be made with the Northern Service Planning team to confirm that the revised path will beworkable for depot flow. As a minimum, 5 minutes must be allowed between arrivals."
