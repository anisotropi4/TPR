""	"The maximum standage behind E840 signal clear of Chapel Road Level Crossing is 87 SLU / 560m. Longer trainsfrom Eastern Docks booked to stop at Northam Junction will instead need to stop behind E838 signal to clear thelevel crossing – this will block 580A points, preventing any movements between Northam Junction and the DepotArrival/Departure Line (Signal E842)."
