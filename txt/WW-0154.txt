Please note – While a Class 80x formed of 9/10 cars is standing in Saltash Platform 1, the junction in rear is
fouled and the AB section from St Budeaux Ferry Road remains occupied. It is not possible for an Up train to
depart or pass Saltash or a following Down train to enter the single line section until after the train in question has
departed Saltash.

An Up train approaching Saltash under cautionary aspects is already braking for the 15mph permanent speed
restriction and therefore the normal SRTs are not compromised.
