1.12.3.1   Option 1: TOVR submitted with new SRT proposal from
           Timetable Participant
       •    Timetable Participant submits TOVR with missing SRTs and proposal for new SRTs to Network
            Rail (NR)
       •    NR receives TOVR and proposal for new SRTs and pauses TOVR response period
       •    NR undertakes quality assurance activity of proposed SRTs (within 5 working days of receipt)
       •    If proposed SRTs pass quality assurance, NR consult new SRTs with affected Timetable
            Participants (5 working days). If proposed SRTs do not pass quality assurance, the TOVR is
            rejected and the Timetable Participant is asked to resubmit their request with revised SRT
            proposals.
       •    After the consultation period ends, NR considers responses and makes a decision about whether
            to take SRTs forward, make amendments or reject the proposal (within 1 working day)
       •    NR informs affected Timetable Participants of the decision and inputs SRTs into Bplan (within 1
            working day)
       •    TOVR response period restarts, usual validation process follows

1.12.3.2   Option 2: TOVR submitted with missing SRTs
       •    Timetable Participant submits TOVR with missing SRTs
       •    NR receives TOVR and pauses TOVR and provides Timetable Participant with option to propose
            new SRTs or to ask NR to undertake SRT calculation exercise and propose new SRTs
       •    If Timetable Participant chooses to propose new SRTs, follow Option 1
       •    If Timetable Participant requests that NR proposes new SRTs, NR will calculate SRTs (within 7
            working days). NR may use computer modelling, TRATIM, observed data, or other sources of data
            that it deems appropriate in calculating the SRT value.
       •    NR consult new SRTs with affected Timetable Participants. The consultation period is 5 working
            days.
       •    After the consultation period ends, NR considers responses and makes decision about whether to
            take SRTs forward, make amendments or reject the proposal (within 1 working day)
       •    NR informs affected Timetable Participants of decision (within 1 day)
       •    Timetable Participant re-submits TOVR with new SRTs to NR and usual validation process follows

1.12.3.3    Option 3a: TOVR submitted with missing SRTs (A4C
            schedules only)
       •    Timetable Participant submits TOVR with missing SRTs
       •    NR receives TOVR and validates using TRT generated within TPS, confirming that this looks to be
            accurate.
       •    NR informs Timetable Participant of missing SRT at time of response to TOVR and gives option to
            propose new SRTs or to ask NR to undertake SRT calculation exercise and propose new SRTs
            (Option 1 or 2)
       •    Option 1 or 2 is followed, SRT is finalised and schedule updated as required.

            Option 3b: TOVR submitted with missing SRTs, requiring expediated consultation
       •    Timetable Participant submits TOVR with missing SRTs and proposal for new SRTs to Network
            Rail (NR)
       •    NR receives TOVR and proposal for new SRTs and pauses TOVR response period
       •    NR undertakes quality assurance activity of proposed SRTs (within 2 working days of receipt)
       •    If proposed SRTs pass quality assurance, NR consult new SRTs with affected Timetable
            Participants (3 working days).
       •    After the consultation period ends, NR considers responses and makes a decision about whether
            to take SRTs forward, make amendments or reject the proposal. SRTs taken forward will be input
            into B-plan (within 1 working day).
       •    TOVR response period restarts and usual validation process follows
