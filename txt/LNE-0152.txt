moves from Platform 1 at Finsbury Park towards Drayton Park. Additionally, any train longer than 308m will also
block back over the route it has taken. No allowances other than a maximum of 1-minute pathing time should be
applied approaching Highbury Vale Jn – trains should be held at Finsbury Park otherwise
