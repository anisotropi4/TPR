* 10-car trains arriving from Fulwell/Shacklegate Junction in passenger service are required to stop in the platform,
then draw forwards following completion of station duties, to sight signal BEF2461 before departing towards the
Depot. This is to be shown as an extended stop at Strawberry Hill between the arrival in passenger service and
the departure of the ECS towards the Depot. The 13-minute minimum reversal time is made up of:
    • 4 minutes standard dwell for arriving in passenger service then departing ECS in the same direction,
    • 2 minutes to draw forwards to the Depot stop car mark.
    • 7 minutes reversal time (standard for 10-car Class 458/701/707).

Planning Note
Trains longer than 8 cars must not be planned to reverse in Platform 2 to travel back towards Twickenham, due to
signal sighting issues.
