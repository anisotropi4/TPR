Crewe Sorting Sidings North SB

Planning Rules
There is no direct route between Gresty Lane Jn and Basford Hall Jn without going through Crewe Basford Hall
Yard (Freightliner). Non-Freightliner services require prior agreement between the operator and Freightliner before
being routed via the yard.
No pathing can be applied between any previous timing point and Crewe Sorting Sidings North SB due to no
intermediate signals.
