Station Working Requirements:
At London Termini 3 minutes to be allowed if possible between arrivals on adjacent platforms to allow customers
to clear in the morning and evening peak.
Platform starting signals must not be operated for trains via the Battersea Reversible line until permission has
been granted from the Signaller operating Panel 7 at Victoria ASC for the movement to proceed beyond TVC541

Overnight:
Maximum use is to be made of Platforms 12 to 15 (These platforms have access to both Fast Line and Slow Line).
The use of Platform 19 should be kept to a minimum because of difficult customer access.

Use of Platforms:
Diesel unit services and whenever possible diesel hauled trains must only use Platform 18 and 19.

For amended timetable purposes, Gatwick Express have the option of using the following alternative Platforms:
