  N.B. Pending a full evaluation of the characteristics of the class 66, the class 56 values shown
  above should be used, subject to any maximum load for a class 66 over the route(s) in
  question.

  Timing Loads used for Container or Heavy Axle Weight Trains

  SRTs for trains conveying vehicles with special characteristics (Containers or Heavy Axle Weight vehicles)
  are calculated as per the methodology described in section 1.4, taking into account any restrictions
  published in the relevant RT3973 form. Where restrictions relating to a specific characteristic are shown (ie.
  Not applying to all trains running with special characteristics) these should be shown as adjustment time in
  section 5.3 of the route TPR document. Within the timing loads, the following references apply:

  H – Train is Heavy Axle Weight
  C – Train is container traffic
  B – Train is both Containers and Heavy Axle Weight
       Other Timing Loads:

  LD    Light Diesel Locomotive
  LE    Light Electric Locomotive
