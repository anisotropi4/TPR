Littleport

Restriction
Down direction trains which exceed the platform length (167m) must not be held in the station for pathing
purposes. Trains no longer than 300m in length may be held at Littleport Signal L22 instead. Trains longer than
300m in length must be held at Littleport Signal L24. This is due to the risk of fouling the level crossing
immediately south of Littleport station.
