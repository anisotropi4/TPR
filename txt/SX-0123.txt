Planning Notes
The non-stop headway applies for consecutive departures from Oxted in the Up direction providing the first train
does not stop at Woldingham, Upper Warlingham and Riddlesdown and the correct headway is applied at the next
common timing point irrespective of calling pattern. National TPR section 1.5.5 Application of Planning Headways
refers.
Trains formed of Class 171 or RHTT units coupled together, cannot reverse at shunt signal 306 unless a driver is
provided at each end as there is no walkway for a single driver to change ends.
