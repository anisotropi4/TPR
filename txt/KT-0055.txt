2.2 Route Opening Hours

Subject to constraints imposed by the Engineering Access Statement, all routes are open continuously, except as
shown below. The hours shown reflect the contractual opening hours. The actual opening hours may vary from
those shown. For a complete listing of current signal box opening hours please refer to the “Compendium of Signal
Box Opening Times” which can be found on the Network Rail website:

If there is doubt about a signal box’s opening hours check with the appropriate Network Rail Operations Manager.

When the routes shown are required for services diverted under the Engineering Access Statement, opening hours
will be increased as necessary on a temporary basis.

Signal boxes equipped to be switched-out during a route’s opening hours are shown within the routes concerned.
