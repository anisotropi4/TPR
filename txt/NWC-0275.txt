Planning Note
All Class 805 services with the timing load 805-D require a minimum 2-minute stop in the station for power
changeover purposes in either direction. Where a station dwell already exists, there is sufficient timing within to
undertake the power changeover. All non-stop and ECS services are required to show a 2-minute OP stop at
Crewe.
