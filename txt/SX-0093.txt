Redhill

Permissive Working
Attaching/Detaching and Platform Sharing is authorised as shown below -
Platform 0 – Up Loop No0            Both Directions       Attaching/Detaching and Platform Sharing*
Platform 1                                                Attaching/Detaching and Platform Sharing up to a
                                                          maximum of 8 x 20 metre cars (platform length 174
                                                          metres)
Platform 2 – Up Loop No2            Both Directions       Attaching/Detaching and Platform Sharing*
Platform 3 – Down Loop              Down Direction        Detaching Only
*Where trains are booked to platform share only in platforms 0 and 2 (e.g. do not attach, detach or run-round), the
station is only capable of accommodating a maximum of two trains at any one time in either platform using this
methodology

Planning Notes
Wherever possible the preferred sequence of Up trains from Platforms 0 and 2 is an Up departure from Platform 2
followed by an Up departure from Platform 0. This is because the route from Platform 0 is restricted by slow speed
crossovers.
The non-stop headway applies for consecutive departures from Redhill towards Stoats Nest Junction providing the
second train uses a different platform and the correct headway is applied at the next timing point irrespective of
calling pattern. National TPR section 1.5.5 Application of Planning Headways refers.
