1.5 Headways
This section covers calculating margins for both conventional and European Train Control System signalling.

1.5.1 Technical Headway
The Technical Headway is the minimum permissible time interval between two successive trains at a specific
timing point on the same line in the same direction,
such that the second train can meet its SRT. This is based on the second schedule receiving the least
restrictive aspect the signal can show, or in ETCS areas, not receiving any indication to reduce speed due to
the first train unless otherwise stated. This is expressed in seconds, and will necessarily vary according to the
types of train and their speed.

This can be calculated as per the following examples.

Diagram A (4-aspect signalling)




Technical Headway at Signal MC513 (above right) is the time elapse between the front of the first train
passing MC513 (showing a green aspect) and its rear clearing the overlap of MC507 (above left), this being
the point at which MC513 would be able to show a green aspect again. To this must be added a system reset
time (normally 4s but this can vary) and sighting time for the second train to see MC513 at green (this is a
standard 9s as used by signal sighting committees).

Hence if the first train were able to maintain 100mph through the section and its length were 240m, the
calculations undertaken would be:

Section (4-Aspect)                    Distance/length (Metres)
Distance MC513 to MC511               1223
Distance MC511 to MC509               1284
Distance MC509 to MC507               1086
Overlap of MC507                      184
Train length                          240
Total                                 4017

For this example, system reset time is 4 seconds, and sighting time is 9 seconds.

4017m at 100mph takes 90s, so adding 4s and 9s this would give a Technical Headway of 103s in this
example. Similarly a 400m-long train that could maintain 60mph though the section would alter the
calculation to: (1223+1284+1086+184+400)m at 60mph – 156s. Adding 4s and 9s gives a Technical
Headway of 169s in this case.
