Restriction
Trains required to run–round:
a) If a train from the Coalville direction requiring to run–round at Knighton Junction has passed Bagworth Junction,
it is not possible for a train from Leicester to enter Knighton Junction to run-round to go towards Coalville. The
train from Coalville will have to run–round and leave the loop before the train from Leicester can enter the loop.
b) If a train from the Leicester direction requiring to run-round is timed into Knighton Junction to run round, it is not
possible for a train from ‘Coalville’ requiring to run–round at Knighton Junction to pass Bagworth Junction. The
train from Leicester will have to have passed Bagworth Junction before the train from ‘Coalville’ can pass
Bagworth Junction.

Run–round Allowance                    25


Leicester Signal LR397 and LR399

Planning Restriction
CrossCountry ECS formed of one Class 170 unit can reverse on either the Down Fast Line (behind Signal LR397)
or on the Up Fast Line (behind Signal LR399).
Under normal circumstances, CrossCountry ECS formed of more than one Class 170 unit can only reverse on the
Up Fast Line due to the lack of a walking route adjacent to the Down Fast Line. However, CrossCountry ECS
formed of more than one Class 170 unit can reverse on the Down Fast Line, but only when two drivers are
provided (by TOC agreement only).
