                        specific timing point on the same line in the same direction, such that the
                        second train can meet its SRT. This is expressed in seconds.

Technical Value         Minimum time between two events on the network based on the physical
                        capability of the infrastructure and rolling stock concerned. This will be
                        expressed in seconds.

Terminal Time           In respect of a freight train, the minimum time required between arrival of
                        one service and departure of the next service, allowing for loading or
                        unloading and including remarshaling and train preparation. Terminal times
                        are indicated in Schedule 5 of Track Access Agreements.

Timetable Impact        A study undertaken to understand the effect of a proposed TPR value
Assessment              change on the operation of the Timetable.

Timetable Participant   (a) an Access Beneficiary; or
                        (b) a Potential Access Party

Timing Point            Nominated points on the network at which trains are timed. A list of these
                        locations is provided in Section 2.1 of the TPRs. Timing points have two
                        categories; mandatory, where all trains are timed, and conditional, where
                        certain trains are timed as detailed in Section 2.1. The timing point is
                        normally the Sectional Appendix mileage. Where no mileage is shown in
                        the Sectional Appendix, the signalling plans should be checked for further
                        information. In the absence of any definitive location, a mileage should be
                        agreed by affected parties, documented and recorded in Section 2.1 of
                        TPR.
                             1. Non-stopping trains – see above
                             2. Terminal stations – see above
                             3. Trains stopping at platforms – appropriate stop board for the length
                                 of train
                             4. Trains stopping in loops – exit signal

TIPLOC                          Timing points are shown in the form of tiplocs in planning systems
                                to enable downstream systems to function. tiplocs are alpha-
                                numeric and have a root of four characters to define a location and
                                up to three additional characters to further define locations in that
                                area. For example, Doncaster has root DONC (which also serves
                                as tiploc for Doncaster station), and further tiplocs are available for
                                other locations in that area such as DONC254 (Doncaster Sig.
                                D254) and DONCUDY (Doncaster Up Decoy).

Turnround Time          The minimum time required for rolling stock to be prepared on completing
                        one service before it forms the next service.
