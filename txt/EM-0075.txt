Syston North Junction

Up trains. There are no signals between Syston North and Syston East Junctions, the Up North Curve.
Therefore, do not time Up trains to stand at Syston East Junction. Also, do not include pathing time between
Syston North and Syston East Junctions. When it is necessary for a train routed via the Up North Curve to follow
another Up train over Syston East Junction the second train cannot pass Syston North Junction until the first train
is 1 minute beyond Syston East Junction if the first train is a passenger train and 2 minutes if it is a freight train.
There are no signals between Syston North and Syston South Junctions. Therefore, do not time trains to stand at
Syston South Junction. Also, do not include pathing time between Syston North and South Junctions.

Down trains. There is limited standage between Syston East and North Junctions, the Down North Curve.
Therefore, it is advisable to avoid timing trains to stand at Syston North Junction unless they consist of either a
light locomotive or a two or three–car dmu. Longer trains would, if stood at Syston North Junction, block Syston
East Junction.
