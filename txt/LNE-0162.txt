Lincoln
The lengths of Platforms 3, 4 and 5 are 144m, 144m and 165m respectively. Trains longer than this e.g. HST
units, can still be planned into these platforms as they will draw past the platform signal, however:

    a) Over-length trains planned into Platform 3 prohibit access to Platforms 1 and 2, the Up Gainsborough
       Line, access into the Terrace Sidings and the bi-directional Down Gainsborough at the Pelham Street end
       of the station; or lock Brayford Junction crossovers (and adjacent level crossings) at the East Homes side,
       depending on direction of travel.
    b) Over-length trains planned into Platform 4 prohibit access to the Down Gainsborough Line and Platform 5
       at the Pelham Street end of the station, or lock Brayford Junction crossovers (and adjacent level
       crossings) at the East Holmes side, depending on direction of travel.
    c) Over-length trains planned into Platform 5 prohibit access to the Down Gainsborough Line and Platform 4
       at the Pelham Street end of the station, or lock Brayford Junction crossovers (and adjacent level
       crossings) at the East Holmes side, depending on direction of travel.

In the case of examples B and C, if the train is routed towards the Spalding Lines, Sincil Bank CCTV barriers need
to be lowered for the duration of the train’s occupation of the platform; and if the train routed towards the Barnetby
Lines, the Pelham Street end of the station will be locked for the duration of the train’s occupation.
