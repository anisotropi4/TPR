Simultaneous Moves Not permitted
A Down train from Hall Royd Jn planned to stand or show pathing time approaching Stansfield Hall Jn must have
a margin of 3 minutes before or after any conflicting move over the Todmorden West Curve. This is due to the
overlap of PN339 signal extending across Stansfield Hall Jn.
