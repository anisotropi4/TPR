Appendix D - Connectional Arrangements
2.19 General Principles
 2.19.1 Timetable Participants should state any requirements for connections within their Access Proposals.
        For each Train Slot in an Access Proposal the Timetable Participants should state any key
        connecting services and the connecting location. Connectional Allowances shown in Timetable
        Planning Rules and/or NRT must be observed. Where one of the connecting services is the
        responsibility of another Timetable Participant and Network Rail has not at that time published agreed
        timings for the Train Slot in question, the Timetable Participants should establish from the other
        Timetable Participant the likely timings of the connecting service and show this in the Access
        Proposal accordingly.

 2.19.2 Network Rail will deal with these key connections as an integral part of the Access Proposal
        consulting with Timetable Participants where proposed flexing has an effect on key connections.
        Network Rail’s proposal will highlight any key connections which are not as Access Proposal.

 2.19.3 A Timetable Participant’s acceptance of a Network Rail proposal includes acceptance of associated
        connections.

 2.19.4 Amendment of an agreed Train Slot will require the agreement of any other Timetable Participant
        having a key connection into or out of the Train Slot in question if the amendment results in a material
        change to the duration or feasibility of the key connection.
