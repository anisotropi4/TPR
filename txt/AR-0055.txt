3 Electrification

3.1 Electrification Supply Restrictions
Under normal conditions, the electrification power supplies will not place any restrictions on the use of approved
electric traction. However, the Route Clearance sections of the Sectional Appendix to the Working Timetables,
issued by, Network Rail do tabulate restrictions on the movement of electric trains. Refer to Table A and select
Route Clearance.

Under maintenance conditions, certain sections of the electrified network may be blocked to electric traction. These
restrictions are contained within the Network Rail Engineering Access Statement for the appropriate year. Additional
restrictions may also arise in connection with engineering possessions requested through the Engineering Access
Statement amendment procedure.

Each section of the electrified network has a finite electrical power supply capability. Intensive use over some
sections of route may result in the system being overloaded. In the event of out-of-course running it may be
necessary to regulate electric traction train paths to facilitate reliable traction power availability.
