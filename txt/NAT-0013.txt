1.6 Junction Margins
 1.6.1       The values listed in Section 5.3 of the TPR are Junction Margins and Station Planning Rules. This
             section covers calculating margins for both conventional and European Train Control System
             signalling.

 1.6.2       A Junction Margin is the minimum permissible time interval between two trains that are performing
             conflicting moves at a timing point, such that the second train can meet its SRT. This is expressed
             in multiples of half minutes derived from the technical value expressed in seconds.

 1.6.3       Where necessary and appropriate, differential junction margins shall be created for different
             combinations of:

         •     Train type (including weight, length and speed)
         •     Stopping or passing movements
         •     Diverging or converging movements

         For example, a train accelerating from rest across a junction will require a greater margin to avoid
         impact on the second train, than a train crossing the same junction at line speed. The stopping
         pattern of both trains must also be taken into account so that acceleration or deceleration relative to
         line speed is taken into account.

 1.6.4       The calculation of a junction margin consists of a number of components:

         1) Time taken between the front of the first train passing the timing point and its rear clearing the
            relevant track circuit or axle counter

         2) Time taken for the signaller or Automatic Route Setting to reset the route and the signals to clear
            or updated Movement Authority issued for the second train

         3) Time taken between the second train sighting the relevant signal, such that it can meet its SRTs,
            or from point before ETCS indication to reduce speed due to the first train and its front passing
            the timing point
