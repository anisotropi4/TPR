Wick

Restriction
If a train is occupying the platform at Wick or in the process of shunting to the Loop or one of the sidings, then the
section from Georgemas Junction to Wick is occupied and a token for this section cannot be issued at Georgemas
Junction. Any such shunt move can commence 5 minutes after an Up train has departed, or 7minutes following a
steam train or a large loco-hauled special departing via the ground frame.


SC205 DINGWALL TO KYLE OF LOCHALSH
General Restriction

At all Token Exchange Points where a token exchange has to be carried out, a minimum dwell of 1 minute is
required. At a number of TEPs along this route, it is possible to receive a Long Section Token, allowing the train to
traverse the next two sections without an intermediate token exchange stop. A Long Section Token can only be
issued if both sections are clear.

The whole RETB area north of Inverness is under the control of a single console at Inverness PSB. Therefore
token exchanges anywhere north of Inverness, on the Thurso/Wick and Kyle lines, cannot happen simultaneously,
irrespective of actual locations; arrivals therefore, at any location, must be a minimum of 1 minute apart.

Dwell Time
Where a token exchange takes place                            1

When both trains are able to fit into the crossing loop, the train that arrives first departs after the second train to
arrive has departed.
