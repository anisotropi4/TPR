Planning Restriction
No pathing time should be applied for any train over 200m in length approaching St Pancras International as any
such train held at Signals TWH200 or TWH198 will lock the preceding crossover between Churchyard Sidings and
the Up & Down Slow. There is then a risk of a stand-off between any train held at Signal TWH200 and any train
departing Platforms 3 or 4 via the Down Fast and routed towards the Down Slow; or between any train held at
Signal TWH198 and any train departing Platforms 1-3 via the Up Fast and routed towards the Down Slow.
