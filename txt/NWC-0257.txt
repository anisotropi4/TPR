Planning Note
For a train to be routed reversibly onto the Up Main the line must be clear to signal ME2029 at Bicester South Jn. A
subsequent train cannot be routed from Bicester South Jn onto the Up Main until the line is clear throughout to
Princes Risborough.

A train is unable to leave Aylesbury towards Princes Risborough if a train is shunting between the bay platform
and platform 2 and vice versa.
