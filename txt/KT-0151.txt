INCLINE JUNCTION

Dwell Time
2 minutes. All trains (Passenger and Freight) towards CTRL from the North London Line must stop at Signal AF41
on approach to York Way South Junction for drivers to set up CSR (Cab Secure Radio) and change traction
setting. This is due to the North London Line not having CSR coverage and CSR must be set up at the first signal
berth on entering a new control area.
