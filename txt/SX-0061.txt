5.2 Headways
The definition for Headways is listed in Section 1.5 of the National TPRs.


5.2.1 Headway Values
All times are in minutes. All routes are shown.
Where track circuit block (TCB) signalling applies, the standard headways for each route are shown, together with any
exceptions.
AB indicates locations where absolute block signalling applies: here the headway is to be calculated from the transit
time of the first of each pair of trains running between the consecutive block posts being considered. To this transit
time shall be added 2 minutes to allow for the signaller’s actions. Exceptions are shown as AB and appear together
with the actual headway value to be used, which includes the allowance for signallers’ actions. Where there is an
intermediate block signal, the absolute block section concerned shall be between this signal and the next block post in
advance.
Single lines and other forms of signalling are shown, together with any values applicable, where they occur.
“OTNS” or “OT” indicates One Train Working with No Train Staff; “OTS” or “OT(S)” indicates One Train Working with
Train Staff. “NST” indicates No Signaller token. In these cases only one train is allowed in the section at one time; a
second train cannot be allowed to enter the section until the first train has left the section.
“ETB” indicates Electric Token Block and “TB” indicates Tokenless Block for single lines.
“RB” indicates Radio Signalling where “long section tokens” can be issued between certain block posts during times
of low traffic volume.

Where headways are shown as being “non-stopping” or “stopping“ these descriptions refer to the service that the path
is following The “stopping” headway should be applied to a service following a preceding service which stops at either
a station or any other location for operational reasons unless stated otherwise within Section 5.2.1 or 5.3 Junction
Margins and Station Planning Rules. The ‘non-stopping’’ headway should be applied to a service following a
preceding service which does not stop at that location. Immediately the preceding service stops at any location for any
reason, the following service headway should be amended to the "stopping’’ value unless stated otherwise within
Section 5.2.1 or 5.3 Junction Margins and Station Planning Rules.

Light Engine movements, postal and test trains to be treated as passenger trains when applying
margins/allowances where there is a freight/passenger difference.

Details of how to apply headways are listed in the National TPRs Section 1.5.5
