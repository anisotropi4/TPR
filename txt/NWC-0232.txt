Tyseley Up and Down Through Sidings

Planning Note
It is preferable for trains arriving in the Up Direction to perform a Run Round to arrive on the Tyseley Up Through
Siding and Run Round via the Tyseley Down Through Siding. It is possible for a train on the Tyseley Down
Through Siding to Run Round via LJ1295 signal (Up Dorridge) at Tyseley South Jn and Small Heath station. The
Run Round should be planned with careful consideration of the opportunities between other services on the Up
and Down Bordesley and Up and Down Snow Hill.
Run Round via Tyseley Down Through Siding                       25 minutes
Run Round via Main Line                                         35 minutes
