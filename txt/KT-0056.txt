3 Electrification

3.1 Electrification Limits
Limits of the 25 kV AC and 750V DC electrification systems are contained in Table A of the Sectional Appendix to
the Working Timetables, issued by, Network Rail. Refer to Table A for the given location to identify the type of
electrification that applies.

3.2 Electrification Supply Restrictions
Under normal conditions, the electrification power supplies will not place any restrictions on the use of approved
electric traction. However, the Route Clearance sections of the Sectional Appendix to the Working Timetables,
issued by, Network Rail do tabulate restrictions on the movement of electric trains. Refer to Table A and select
Route Clearance.

Under maintenance conditions, certain sections of the electrified network may be blocked to electric traction.
These restrictions are contained within the Network Rail Rules of the Route for the appropriate year. Additional
restrictions may also arise in connection with engineering possessions requested through the Rules of the Route
amendment procedure.
