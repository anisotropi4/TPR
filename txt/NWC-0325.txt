Planning Restriction
A bi-directional movement cannot arrive into the Down Wilmslow (platform 3) at the same time as a movement is
signalled to depart the Up Styal (Platform 2) to the Up Wilmslow, due to the signalling overlap

$ Where first movement is an arrival into platform 3 (Down Stoke) the overlap from signal MS391 is set to the Up
Wilmslow. The next arrive/pass on the Up Main to Up Wilmslow must be 4 minutes after the first movement departs
platform 3.

Planning Note
A train can be routed from the Down Stoke into Platform 3 at Cheadle Hulme at the same time as a train from the
Down Wilmslow is routed through Platform 1 to the Down Main. In these circumstances no Up trains can pass
Adswood Road Jn to the Up Main until the train from the Down Wilmslow has passed Adswood Road Jn

Platform Reoccupation Time             2½ After train on Up Wilmslow passes clear of the junction. This only applies
Down Macclesfield arrival into         to trains which stop at Cheadle Hulme
Platform 3 only
