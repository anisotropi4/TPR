restrictions


Tanners Hill Junction

Junction Margins                                                                                      Margin
Between all movements                                                                                 2*
* - 1½ minutes is permissible but not for successive moves

Length Restrictions
A train exceeding 315m/49SLU in length on the Up Tanners Hill will foul the route on the Down Lewisham when
standing at TL238.
Therefore, junction margins must be based on train’s departure time at Tanners Hill Junction


Parks Bridge Junction

Planning Note
Parks Bridge Junction is collectively used to describe 3 independent junctions, School, Parks Bridge and Courthill
Loop South. Junction margins for all conflicting moves are calculated and validated at Parks Bridge Junction. As
multiple conflicting moves may occur, planners should ensure they are aware of all potential conflicts and apply
margins appropriately
