Excursion Sidings. Trains arrive into platform 1, then propel into the Excursion Sidings, then run-round,
propelling back into platform 1 before departure. The Excursion Sidings can accommodate a second train but this
can only take place after the first train has completed a run round; therefore can only leave platform 1, 30 minutes
after the first. The second train can only commence a run round after the first train has returned to platform 1;
planners must satisfy themselves there is adequate time between the first train arriving platform 1, and the second
train moving to that platform. All such moves to be fully timed
