Method of working
Arrivals
For any trains arriving on the Down Slow via a shunt move, the controller on site must obtain permission from the
signaller to occupy the Up Slow so a radio can be safely passed to the driver to perform a radio test. The train will
then draw clear of Limbury North GF.

For any trains arriving on the Up Slow, the driver must pick up a radio from the controller on site and, after a
satisfactory radio test, draw forward clear of Limbury South GF. Please note it is not possible to access the sidings
directly from the Up Slow.

Trains to and from the south will depart via Limbury South GF to the Up Slow Line.
Trains to and from the north will depart via Limbury North GF to the Down Slow Line.

Planning Note
Margins are calculated based off a 2 minute RM at the ground frame before entry. SRTs are calculated based on
propelling into Limbury Road.


Leagrave

Planning Note
No timing allowances should be applied between Leagrave and Leagrave Junction as there are no intermediate
signals
