March

CrossCountry trains departing March in the Down direction to be advertised to depart 1 minute earlier than WTT if
they depart on a whole minute. (This is to help mitigate late running in the event the train encounters cautionary
signals on the approach to Norwood Road Level Crossing.)

Planning Note
Freight trains, less than 76 SLUs, stopping in the down direction for crew relief, must be planned to stop in the
Down Goods Loop if available. Stopping in the down platform at March results in the level crossing being blocked
for an extended period of time.
