5.1.4 Timing of Trains Consisting of Passenger Vehicles on Goods Lines
The sectional running timings quoted for trains consisting of passenger vehicles on Goods Lines reflect the
speeds shown in the relevant Table ‘A’ of the appropriate Sectional Appendix. They do not constitute an authority
to time trains conveying passengers on a Goods Lines. Nor do they reflect the permitted speeds at which a train
conveying passengers can proceed. Network Rail will offer the sectional running times for trains conveying
passengers on a Goods Line on a train-by-train basis. For those times please apply to the Capacity Planning
Department.

Operations Publications publish the authority to allow the planned operation of trains conveying passengers on
Goods Lines. Before Operations Publications can grant authority they require confirmation that the track is fit for
purpose and that there is a safe method of operation. Therefore, the Capacity Planning Department must apply
to the relevant Track Engineer and Operations Manager for confirmation of these requirements in writing. The
Capacity Planning Department must pass these responses to Operations Publications. The Capacity Planning
Department is responsible for advising Operations Publications of the requirement to operate a passenger train
on a Goods Line at least 8 weeks before the day of operation.
