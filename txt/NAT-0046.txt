5 International Train Slots
    5.1.1      Capacity needs to be provided on the network to facilitate the operation of international
               passenger and freight trains. The planning of these Train Slots needs to be coordinated
               between Network Rail and other European Infrastructure Managers, and special provisions have
               been made in the Network Code Part D to recognise the added complication involved.

5.1 Passenger
    5.1.2      The International Freight Capacity Notice details the Train Slots required and is formally notified
               at D-70 through email correspondence.
