6 Timetabling Considerations
6.1 Advertised and Working Times
It is not permissible for trains to be specified to be advertised to arrive before or depart after the booked times stated
in the working timetable (WTT).

It is permissible for trains to be specified to be advertised to depart before the booked times stated in the working
timetable in the following circumstances;

(i) Where the WTT departure time is delayed to achieve the required headway behind a preceding train or margin
following a conflicting move.

(ii) As an aid to punctual departure where this practice has been agreed between the Train Operator and Network
Rail.

By agreement between the Train Operator and Network Rail, trains may be specified to be advertised to arrive after
the booked times stated in the WTT. This agreement is used instead of engineering/performance allowances.
