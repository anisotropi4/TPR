Operating Restrictions
When shunt moves are taking place at Angmering, services should not be timed to arrive into Platform 2 until 4
minutes after the ECS from the Down Brighton line has arrived into Angmering Platform 1. This allows enough
time for the ground frame to be cleared and the crossover switched back in the normal position.
