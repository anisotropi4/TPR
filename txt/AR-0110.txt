Overlap Restrictions
If a train is starting from Platform 2 and routed via the preferred route (line code DS) towards Bury Street Junction
this will conflict with the overlap of signal L1395 on the Down Southbury approaching Cheshunt, so it is not
possible for a train to depart from Theobalds Grove towards L1395. This also applies to a departure from Platform
3 (see margins above).

If a train is starting from Platform 2 and routed via the non-preferred route (line code UC) towards Bury Street
Junction that this will conflicts with the overlap of signal L1060 on Platform 1.
