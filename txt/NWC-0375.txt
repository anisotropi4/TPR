Overlap Restrictions
Once a train has departed Buxton Signal Box towards Great Rocks Jn, no other train can pass Peak Forest South
SB towards Great Rocks Jn. This is due to the overlap from signal GR13 at Great Rocks Jn conflicting with the
route to or from Tunstead Sidings, and the overlap from signal GR16 conflicting with the route to or from Buxton
SB. This is accounted for in the junction margins.


Tunstead Sidings

Operating Restriction
Owing to the adverse gradients between Great Rocks Jn and Peak Forest South SB a train, where possible,
should be planned to have a clear road through to Chinley South Jn.
