5.3 Junction Margins and Station Planning Rules
The definition for Junction Margins and Station Planning Rules is listed in Section 6.6 - 6.10 of the National TPRs.
Line of Route
All times shown are in minutes. Where adjustments to sectional running times are shown, the value must be added
to the normal SRTs shown in B Plan. Negative adjustments are specially identified.

Minimum station allowances are the minimum practical for the particular type of stock. These are shown with
exceptions being listed by line of route where applicable.
Light Engine movements, postal and test trains to be treated as passenger trains when applying margins/ allowances
where there is a freight/ passenger difference.



STANDARD VALUES – MINIMUM
Adjustment to Sectional Running Times
A ½ minute adjustment should be included in all trains* approaching the termination point, where otherwise the
terminating time would include an odd half-minute.
*Except at London Paddington to allow trains to run at 2½ minute headways if required, and except at Twyford and
Henley (for self-contained Henley Branch services ONLY), to enable a half-hourly service frequency.

Brake Testing
Great Western Railway 80X services require a {½}-minute running brake test allowance to be included in each
schedule timed using 802-E or 802-D timing loads, at the first practical opportunity that a running speed of 40mph
or higher is achievable, or prior to the first stop (whichever occurs first.) This is a mandatory allowance, to apply at
the start of each journey, after any driver change, change to train formation or any reversal en-route. It is not to be
applied during local shunt moves or ECS moves on/off depots. Where doubt exists, please request advice from the
Train Operator
Trains originating on whole minutes
CrossCountry* and Freight^ schedules must depart from origin on a whole minute. (This is due to limitations with IT
system requirements – *Integrale, ^TOPS)
