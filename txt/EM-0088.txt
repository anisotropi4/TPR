Platform Constraint
Due to permissive working rules, it is not possible for simultaneous arrivals and departures within platform 1, 3, 4,
6, 7 i.e. an arrival in 6a and departure from 6b, or arrival in 6b and departure from 6a

Planning Note
Down direction (Eastbound)
A train exceeding 200m in length will foul Mansfield Junction when pathing time is applied between Mansfield
Junction and Nottingham. Therefore, junction margins must be based on trains’ arrival/pass time at Nottingham.

Up direction (Westbound)
A train exceeding 200m in length will foul Nottingham West Junction if held at Mansfield Junction or when pathing
time is applied between Nottingham and Mansfield Junction. Therefore, junction margins must be based on trains’
pass/departure time at Mansfield Junction.
