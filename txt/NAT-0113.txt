•     Gathering information from differing data sources will start to build a picture of what is happening
      during a station dwell. Each data source will need to be assessed for its suitability for providing
      valid information to a station dwell review.

•     The most common sources of data used in a station dwell review are listed in the table below, with
      pros and cons. GPS/OTMR data provides the most reliable wheels stop to wheels start time for
      large sample sizes, but other data sources also have pros that should be considered when
      completing a review of dwell performance.

      •   Data from any source should be cleansed to make sure it only includes data relevant to
          passenger train timings, including the relevant timing loads and stopping patterns.

      •   If a data source uses berth offsets, then the berth offset should be validated for accuracy before
          any other changes to the station dwell are proposed.
