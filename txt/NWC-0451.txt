6 Timetabling Considerations
6.1 Advertised and Working Times
It is not permissible for trains to be specified to be advertised to arrive before or depart after the booked
times stated in the working timetable (WTT).

It is permissible for trains to be specified to be advertised to depart before the booked times stated in the
working timetable in the following circumstances;

(i) Where the WTT departure time is delayed to achieve the required headway behind a preceding train
    or margin following a conflicting move.

(ii) As an aid to punctual departure where this practice has been agreed between the Train Operator and
     Network Rail.

By agreement between the Train Operator and Network Rail, trains may be specified to be advertised to
arrive after the booked times stated in the WTT. This agreement is used instead of
engineering/performance allowances.

6.2 Timing of Light Locomotives
It is a general principle that all light locomotive movements will be timed. Any exceptions to this must be
agreed by the appropriate Operational Planning Manager.
