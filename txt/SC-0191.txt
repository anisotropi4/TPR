Operating Restriction
Trains cannot arrive simultaneously; must arrive at least ½ minutes apart as per margins above. However, trains
can depart simultaneously subject to satisfying the above rules.

Loop Length Restriction/Operating Instructions
Trains must not exceed 307 metres / 47 SLU if using mainline or 321 metres / 50 SLU if using Down Loop. A train
exceeding these lengths can pass (i.e not stop) another train subject to the above margins. Stopping trains
normally use the Up platform, except when passing/being passed by an Up service.
Down trains may ‘overtake’ another Down train, the train being overtaken standing at the Down platform, the
overtaking train stopping at or passing through the Up platform
