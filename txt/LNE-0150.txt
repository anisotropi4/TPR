Planning Restrictions
a) Trains from the Sheffield direction arriving into Platform 3b will hold the overlap so trains cannot arrive into
Platform 1 from the Up Main line/Leeds Line. Trains from the Shaftholme Junction direction can access Platform 1

shown in the timetable as Adjustment allowance.

b) Trains longer than 234m arriving in the Up direction into Platform 3a will foul the block joint in rear and prevent

                                     Electronic copy - uncontrolled when printed.
