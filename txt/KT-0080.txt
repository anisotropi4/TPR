5.2.2 General Capacity Constraints
Where single line working is to operate or trains are to be routed to run on a line other than that normally planned for
them, constraints on capacity will apply – see the Engineering Access Statement.

The following special capacity and timing restrictions apply in addition to the constraints stated elsewhere in this
document:

ETCS Level 2 operating within GTR trains will normally be operatational between Blue Anchor Junction and
Blackfriars Junction via the Snow Hill Lines and lines 4 & 5. Special operational arrangements will need to apply for
trains taking alternative routes between these locations. A 2½ minute headway is therefore allowed between
consecutive trains operated by ETCS compatible rolling stock
