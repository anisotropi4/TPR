 4.1.6    This asset information is used to satisfy the requirements of mandated engineering standards.

4.2    Train Slots to deliver the train service requirements included in these tables will be developed during
       the timetable drafting period and as such the trains shown should be considered the preliminary Train
       Slots.

 4.2.1    Inclusion within these National Timetable Planning Rules will accord Network Service and
          Measurement trains that meet the threshold of being planned to run at least once in any 13-week
          period equal priority to the Firm Rights of Timetable Participants in respect of conflict resolution
          decisions across all timetable periods.

 4.2.2    Inclusion within these National Timetable Planning Rules will accord Railhead Treatment Trains
          equal priority to the Firm Rights of Timetable Participants in respect of conflict resolution decisions
          across the timetable period(s) identified in Section 2.18.

4.3    In accordance with Timetable Planning Rules Section 1, Train Operators may use the timetable
       process to seek dated train paths which may conflict with the Railhead Treatments Trains listed in
       Appendix 1 outside of the published “Leaf Fall” timetables (see Timetable Planning Rules Section 1.22
       for applicable dates). Train Operators are encouraged to provide details of the “conflicting” RHTT
       schedule when submitting an access proposal.

4.4    Where neccessary, Network Rail will endeavour to provide a decision which may result in two or more
       dated variants of the same train; with one outside of the published “Leaf Fall” timetable and a second
       train path within the published “Leaf Fall” timetable, but not conflicting with the Railhead Treatment
       Train.

(All services shown in the Appendix I tables are WTT compliant as of the May 2021 timetable)

4.5    The Maximum Variation in departure time, arrival time or of any intermediate point required for
       operational reasons (eg. Train crew) of any Network Service detailed in Appendix 1 shall be no more
       than 30 minutes from the corresponding time (at any location) for the corresponding Train Slot in the
       preceding Timetable Period

4.6    Where Railhead Treatment Trains are required to run outside the dates shown in section 2.18, a TOVR
       should be submitted through the STP process for the desired train path.
