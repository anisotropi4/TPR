Planning Note
Margins for trains to/from Snow Hill need to be applied in conjunction with rules at Birmingham Snow Hill. A train
cannot depart Birmingham Moor Street if there is not a platform available at Birmingham Snow Hill or vice versa

There are no signals between Birmingham Moor Street and Birmingham Snow Hill therefore no pathing time to be
used between these locations
