* The second portion is not permitted to approach from the Down Main line
# 10-car trains cannot detach in platform 2
$ SWR services cannot attach or detach in Platform 1 due to the curvature of the track.
^ If platform occupied by more than 104m train (5-car Class 458/701/707), then it is not possible for another
train to be permissively signalled into the platform.

Restrictions
Up trains from Virginia Water longer than 10-cars calling in platform 1 will prevent down departures towards
Windsor – the junction margin must be based on the departure time of the up train in this instance. This
restriction also applies to 10-car class 444 calling in platform 1.
