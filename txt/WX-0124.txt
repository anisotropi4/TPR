Station Working Requirements
    • All attachments to up trains must be made by bringing the up train to a stand in the Platform, and
        attaching the portion at the London via signals SE4721 or SE4723. The shunt move must be made via
        SE4721 or SE4723 after the up train has arrived as it is not possible to be at a stand at SE4721 or
        SE4723 as this is in the overlap of SE4718 or SE4714
