For Southall West Jn, the correct Junction Margin to be applied is to be based on the slowest set of
crossovers which the first train will travel over.

*Trains can arrive and depart from Southall Station whilst a conflicting move is taking place at Southall
West Junction, a junction margin time should be applied before the next TIPLOC in the down direction if a
conflicting move will occur as Southall West Junction is not a mandatory timing point in the down
direction

There should be no pathing added between Southall and Southall West in the down direction
