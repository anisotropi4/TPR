4.7 Engineersâ€™ Trains Restrictions
Some On Track Machines (OTMs) do not reliably activate track circuits. These OTMs must use one of the
following special reporting numbers 6Z09, 7Z09 or 8Z09*. Because these OTMs do not reliably activate track
circuits it is not possible to apply the headways and junction margins as outlined in Timetable Planning Rules
consistently and it is therefore not possible for Operational Planning to provide timings for these movements.
