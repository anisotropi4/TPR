Planning Note
It is not possible to add timing allowances between Maidenhead East Jn and Maidenhead as there are no
intermediate signals, though {1} for permissive platform arrivals remains required. If an engineering allowance is
required in a Down train approaching Maidenhead (see Section 5.5), and the train is also timed at Maidenhead
East Jn, then the allowance should instead be applied at Maidenhead East Jn.
