SC203 INVERNESS TO WICK
General Restriction
At all Token Exchange Points where a token exchange has to be carried out, a minimum dwell of 1 minute is
required. At a number of TEPs along this route, it is possible to receive a Long Section Token, allowing the train to
traverse the next two sections without an intermediate token exchange stop. A Long Section Token can only be
issued if both sections are clear.

The RETB area north of Inverness is under the control of two consoles at Inverness PSB. One module controls
Inverness – Invergordon & Dingwall – Kyle of Lochalsh and the second module controls Invergordon – Georgemas
Junction, Wick & Thurso. Token exchanges on the same module cannot happen simultaneously, irrespective of
actual locations; arrivals therefore, at any location, must be a minimum of 1minute apart. Token exchanges on
different modules can happen simultaneously.

Dwell Time
Where a token exchange takes place                            1 (unless otherwise specified)

Crossing Margins
When both trains are able to fit into the crossing loop, the train that arrives first departs after the second train to
arrive has departed.

When one of the trains is longer than the crossing loop, the train longer than the crossing loop always departs first.
