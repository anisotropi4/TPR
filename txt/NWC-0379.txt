Overlap Restriction – Buxton SB to Great Rocks Jn
A train cannot depart Buxton URS towards Great Rocks Jn if there is a conflicting move at Great Rocks Jn due to
the overlap on signal GR13 at Great Rocks Jn. This is accounted for in the junction margins above.
Once a train has departed Buxton SB towards Great Rocks Jn, no other conflicting move can occur at Great
Rocks Jn. Refer to Great Rocks Jn entry for details.
