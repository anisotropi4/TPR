Bathampton Junction
Refer to GW105 for junction margins and allowances

Pathing time
It IS not permitted to show pathing time approaching Bathampton Junction from the GW510 direction, due to ARS
constraints. It is necessary to show such allowances as an A stop at BL1995 signal TIPLOC.

GW540 FILTON JUNCTION TO PATCHWAY JUNCTION

Patchway
For Filton Abbey Wood rules refer to GW450 and for Patchway refer to GW600

GW5401 FILTON WEST JUNCTION TO PATCHWAY JUNCTION (PATCHWAY
CHORD)
Trains from Filton West Jn must not have pathing time or stops added approaching Patchway, this should be
added approaching Filton West Jn instead. Signal BL1834 (approaching Filton West Jn) cannot be cleared until
BL2046 (protecting Patchway Junction) is cleared, this is due to the risk of trains rolling back over ‘Filton Tip
AOCL’.
