Planning Restrictions
For a Down arrival/pass from Holme into Platform 4 or 5 to receive an unregulated/clear run, there must be no
planned movements across the Spital Junction to/from Platforms 4, 5 or 6 from up to 2 minutes after the Down
train has passed Holme, and then not until 1 minute after this train has departed Peterborough. If this isn’t
achievable, then the below adjustments must be applied:

Down Trains
Due to overlap restrictions at the north of the station, approach control allowances are required approaching
Platforms 4 and 5, when there is a conflicting move across the north-end ladder (Spital Junction). Therefore,
adjustment must be applied approaching Peterborough (see Adjustments to Sectional Running Times)

Up Trains
If there is a departure or arrival into Platform 1 or 2 to/from Fletton Jn via the Fast Lines within 2½ mins of an
arrival into Platform 3 from the Up Fast line, the Platform 3 arrival must have 1-minute adjustment added for
double conditional reds (P468 & P440 signals) between Tallington Jn and Peterborough

Other general restrictions
Maximum standage between Sig P434 on March Independent Line and Sig P444 on Platform 5 is 516m (81
SLUs).

Any trains planned to stand at Sig P434 having passed through Platform 5, that are longer than the maximum
standage length, will lock the preceding block section.

Any Down direction train longer than 292m (46 SLUs) in length and planned to stand at Platform 5 will prevent any
pass, arrival or departure into/from Platform 6 across Spital Ladder, as the overlap beyond Signal P434 will not
time out.

No timing allowances should be applied between Peterborough and Spital Junction South as there are no
intermediate signals

There is no signalled route from Platform 4 to the Up Slow Line in the Down direction


Peterborough Virtual Quarry

Planning Restriction
Any train longer than 67 SLU/427m on Virtual Quarry Line 1 and 68 SLU/438m on Virtual Quarry Line 2 will block
access to/from the south end of the adjacent line
