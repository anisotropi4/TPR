 1.4.4       To take account of factors such as permissive moves, slow speed junctions, crossovers and
             platform sharing, additional time in the form of adjustment allowance should be added to schedules
             and listed in Section 5.3 of the TPR. If this additional allowance applies to all trains using the SRT,
             this allowance should be included in the SRT.

 1.4.5       It is permissible to include percentage uplift in SRTs instead of applying engineering recovery
             allowances to be agreed by all affected parties.

 1.4.6       SRTs are split by type into 4 different timing links:

         •     Stop to Pass – wheels start at first timing point to front of train passing the second timing point
         •     Pass to Pass – front of train passing the first timing point and passing the second timing point
         •     Pass to Stop – the front of train passing first timing point to wheels stop at second timing point
         •     Stop to Stop – wheels start at first timing point to wheels stop at second timing point

 1.4.7       When technical values range between 1 and 14 seconds, values should be rounded to the full
             minute below and when technical values range between 31 and 44 seconds, values should be
             rounded to the half minute below. For instance, a technical value of 1 minute 14 seconds becomes
             1 minute, whereas a technical value of 1 minute 31 seconds becomes 1 minute 30 seconds.

 1.4.8       When technical values range between 15 and 29 seconds values should be rounded to the next half
             minute above and when technical values range between 45 and 59 seconds, values should be
             rounded to the next full minute above. For instance, a technical value of 1 minute 29 seconds
             becomes 1 minute 30 seconds, whereas a technical value of 1 minute 45 seconds becomes 2
             minutes.

 1.4.9       If the technical value falls exactly on the 0 or 30 second mark no rounding will be added. For
             instance, a technical value of 2 minutes or 2 minutes 30 seconds will be translated to an SRT with
             no rounding up or down.

 1.4.10 Consideration needs to be given to the criticality of the timing points in question and to operational
        characteristics, as well as the ‘real world’ implications, that may mean occasions when 1.4.7 -1.4.9
        are over-ridden.

 1.4.11 Cumulative rounding will apply over sections of combined SRTs based on the principles outlined
        above. The table below provides an example of rounding:




 1.4.12 SRTs should not be so generous that trains run and arrive early, having an adverse impact on
        performance, safety and capacity.

 1.4.13 SRTs should allow for reasonable variations in operational performance. SRT calculations based on
        observed data should not be standardised on neither the lowest nor the highest observed value as
        this will artificially produce a lower or higher value than is realised in normal day to day operation.
