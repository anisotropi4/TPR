Simultaneous moves not permitted

Up train approaching E758 signal on Redbridge          Train crossing to/from Maritime FLT
Goods from Maritime West Junction

Planning Notes
A train in excess of 94 SLU stood at E755 signal on the Maritime Back Road will foul the Up Docks Branch at
Millbrook. Therefore, junction margins at Millbrook should be based on the departure time from Maritime East
Junction if this is the case.
A train in excess of 68 SLU stood at E757 signal on the Redbridge Goods will foul the Down Fast at Church Lane
Junction (545A points). Therefore, junction margins at Church Lane Junction should be based on the departure
time from Maritime East Junction if this is the case.
