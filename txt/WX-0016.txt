2 Route Description

2.1 Planning Geography
Line of route
Network Rail maintains the planning geography and issues it to Train Operators using the BPlan system. BPlan data
is to be regarded as the master geography and it is the responsibility of Train Operators and nominated Network Rail
users to ensure that data in their train planning systems reflects the master geography.

It is essential that all locations, times and full details such as Platforms, running lines, activities, etc. comply fully with
all of the following rules. Any Network Links used for buses only are to have running line defined as BUS. All data
used by a specifier must be that supplied by Network Rail: use of estimated times added or amended locally will
cause the trains concerned to fail validation.

In order to avoid the creation of unnecessary journey legs and associated point-to-point timings, all passing times
must conform to these rules.


Locations in bold type and underlined are mandatory timing points i.e. apply to all trains on the specified line of
route.

Locations in bold type are conditional timing points with a mandatory element. These are locations where all trains
travelling on a specific line or in a specific direction are required to be timed at this location, which will be defined in
the Notes column. For lines/directions for which the mandatory element does not apply they are to be treated as non-
mandatory timing points and are only required to be shown in connection with a specific activity with one or more of
the codes shown below in the Code column.

Locations in normal type are non-mandatory timing points and are required to be shown only for a specific activity
with one or more of the codes shown below in the Code column.

Locations in italic type are not timing points but are shown for reference purposes.

Line references shown in italics e.g. SW100 are only for reference purposes.


In the tables below, the following codes apply:
F           Only freight trains are timed here
P           Only passenger trains are timed here
S           Only stopping trains are timed here
X           Only trains crossing from one running line to another are timed here
