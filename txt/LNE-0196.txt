Restrictions
• A down train longer than 178m arriving into Platforms 3/4 will foul the route to and from South Hylton. This
   train cannot turn round in the platform and return south and must depart towards Newcastle at least 1½
   minutes before the next Metro departs towards South Hylton.
• A down train longer than 195m can only arrive into Platforms 1/2 by prior agreement between the Train
   operator and the Local Operations Manager. The rear of the train will ‘lock’ the crossovers at the south end of
   the station, preventing moves to/from other platforms.
• Metro trains can only use No. 2 Siding; No. 1 Siding is not electrified
