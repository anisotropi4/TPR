Junction Margins
Due to the restrictive length of the chord and overlap issues at Galton Jn, trains towards Soho Junctions from
Smethwick Jn must not be planned to be held at Galton Jn itself. Use of suitable adjustment values must be used
to hold the train at Smethwick Jn on route MD435 before crossing Galton Jn towards the Soho Junctions.
