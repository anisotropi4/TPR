5.2 Headways
The definition for Headways is listed in Section 1.5 of the National TPRs.

5.2.1 Headway Values
All times are in minutes. All routes are shown.

Where track circuit block (TCB) signalling applies, the standard headways for each route are shown, together with
any exceptions.

AB indicates locations where absolute block signalling applies. Here the headway is to be calculated from the transit
time of the first of each pair of trains running between the stated timing points. A value “x” shall be added to the
transit time to allow for the signaller’s actions and sighting of the relevant signal. The planning headway is shown as
“AB+x”.

AB methodology may also be used to express the headway in other areas (e.g.TCB), the value “x” including the time
taken to reset the route, clear the signal on entry to the section and sight the relevant signal
Single lines and other forms of signalling are shown, together with any values applicable, where they occur.

“OTNS” or “OT” indicates One Train Working with No Train Staff; “OTS” or “OT(S)” indicates One train Working
with Train Staff. “NST” indicates No Signaller token. In these cases only one train is allowed in the section at one
time; a second train cannot be allowed to enter the section until the first train has left the section.

Where headways are shown as being “non-stopping” or “stopping“ these descriptions refer to the service that the
path is following. The “stopping” headway should be applied to a service following a preceding service which stops at
either a station or any other location for operational reasons unless stated otherwise within Section 5.2.1 or 5.3
Junction Margins and Station Planning Rules. The ‘’non-stopping’’ headway should be applied to a service following
a preceding service which does not stop at that location. Immediately the preceding service stops at any location for
any reason, the following service headway should be amended to the "stopping’’ value unless stated otherwise within
Section 5.2.1 or 5.3 Junction Margins and Station Planning Rules.

Light Engine movements postal and test trains to be treated as passenger trains when applying
margins/allowances where there is a freight/passenger difference.

Details of how to apply headways are listed in the National TPRs Section 1.5.5

Headways in Kent are applied on the depart to depart methodology.
