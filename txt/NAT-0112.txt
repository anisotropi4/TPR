       Appendix K – Dwell Time Methodology Guide
       Introduction
 •     This guide has been designed to accompany the rounding methodology for Station Dwells
       contained in Section 1.3 of the National Timetable Planning Rules

 •     The guide has been split into two key topics:
            • Data
            • Consultation

       This guide provides advice on how to use data and best practice for consultation when carrying out
       a station dwell review

 •     Normally, the starting point for a station dwell investigation will be performance data that suggests
       that a dwell is currently not being met. This data should prompt further investigation to understand
       why this result is being shown.

 •     As expertise for the various solutions sit in multiple areas; a three-pronged approach should be
       taken for the review involving; NR Capacity Planning, the Operator and NR Route Performance.

 •     Working together will also ensure that the reviews are more effective and shared objectives are
       agreed upfront. More details on collaboration are provided in the consultation section of this guide.

 •     Only when it is known why a data source is returning the result, can the best solution be reached to
       increase dwell adherence, or the performance data can be knowledgably discounted.

 •     If new or, alternative rolling stock is introduced to a Line of Route then the standard values should
       be reviewed, and any new values required should be published in the relevant route Timetable
       Planning Rules.

 •     There are many solutions to improving dwell adherence such as, but not exclusive to:
            • Operational changes – including the dispatch process
            • Changing the berth offsets1
            • Amending other TPR values, such as SRTs
            • Re-balancing dwells across a line of route
            • Increasing the planned dwell


Data




       1 Berth offset values adjust time at signal to time at TIPLOC and are used in SMART, ODA, and Quartz data. Each station will have two
       offsets – a departure offset which is a number of seconds taken for a train to reach the signal beyond a location, and an arrival offset
       which is a number of seconds taken for a train to arrive at a location after passing the signal before the location.

       The value is calculated as an average of all services passing that point during the period of observations. As the value is an average,
       there are a number of variables that can affect the figure, most of which apply to the different mix of traffic using a location:

                       •   Different traction types – different traction types have different maximum speeds, rates of braking and acceleration.
                       •   Mix of stopping and passing services.
                       •   Mix of passenger and freight services.
                       •   Variations in driver behaviour.
                       •   Different lengths of trains.
