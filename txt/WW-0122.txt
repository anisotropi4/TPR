From Marlow/Bourne End                4

Signalled Moves
It is not possible for a train to be signalled into Platform 5 from the Down Main or Down Relief Line, via
Maidenhead East Junction, when a train is arriving into platform 4 in the up direction
Class 16X services arriving into Platform 5 from the east, should be no more than 5 vehicles in length.
This is due to the presence of an intermediate Stop-Car Marker, which ensures that services from Marlow can be
routed permissively into Platform 5, even when the London end of the platform is occupied.
Movements from Platform 5, shunting to another platform, cannot be routed via Maidenhead East, and should be
timed via the stabling lines.
