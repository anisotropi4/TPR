5.2 Headways
The definition for Headways is listed in Section 1.5 of the National TPRs.


5.2.1 Headway Values
All times are in minutes. All routes are shown.

Where track circuit block (TCB) signalling applies, the standard headways for each route are shown, together with
any exceptions.

AB indicates locations where absolute block signalling applies. Here the headway is to be calculated from the transit
time of the first of each pair of trains running between the stated timing points. A value “x” shall be added to the
transit time to allow for the signaller’s actions and sighting of the relevant signal. The planning headway is shown as
“AB+x”.

AB methodology may also be used to express the headway in other areas (e.g., TCB), the value x including the time
taken to reset the route, clear the signal on entry to the section and sight the relevant signal.

Single lines and other forms of signalling are shown, together with any values applicable, where they occur.

“OTNS” or “OT” indicates One Train Working with No Train Staff; “OTS” or “OT(S)” indicates One train Working with
Train Staff. “NST” indicates No Signaller token. In these circumstances only one train is allowed in the section at
one time; a second train cannot be allowed to enter the section until the first train has left the section.

“ETB” indicates Electric Token Block and “TB” indicates Tokenless Block for single lines.

“RB” indicates Radio Signalling where “long section tokens” can be issued between certain block posts during times
of low traffic volume.

Light Engine movements, postal and test trains to be treated as passenger trains when applying margins/allowances
where there is a passenger/freight differential.

Details of how to apply headways are listed in the National TPRs Section 1.5.5.
