Planning Notes
An up train in excess of 93 SLU stood at Maritime West Jn signal E770 will be foul of the Up and Down Main lines
at Redbridge. Therefore, junction margins at Redbridge should be based on departure time from Maritime West Jn
if this is the case.
A down train in excess of 93 SLU stood at Redbridge signal E779 will be foul of Maritime West Jn. Therefore,
junction margins at Maritime West Jn should be based on departure time from Redbridge if this is the case.
