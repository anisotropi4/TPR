Simultaneous Moves Not Permitted – Freight (Class 4, 6, 7 or non-seasonal Class 8)
A freight train (as described above) arriving in the Down direction which is running into Purley Yard is required to
proceed past signal T167 at the country end of Platform 6 in order to clear the pointwork for the Yard. Under the
instructions of the shunter, the train will then be propelled into the Down Siding. Whilst the shunt is taking place no
route is available from Platform 5 signal T165 towards Caterham or Tattenham Corner. As soon as the train has
cleared Platform 6, a departure towards Caterham or Tattenham Corner from Platform 5 can proceed.
