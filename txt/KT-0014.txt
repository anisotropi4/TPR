Thameslink services †
Northbound Services                                EVEN NUMBERS*
Southbound Services                                ODD NUMBERS*

* Some services during the AM & PM peak will be given numbers between 80 and 99 to illustrate differences with the off-
peak pattern. These may deviate from the numbering convention, by exception, with prior consultation between Network
Rail and the Operator.

† This includes Thameslink operated services which start and terminate short of the Thameslink Core route.

Note:
The use of number range 80 to 99 should be used to illustrate trains which deviate from the normal pattern behaviour, be
that calling pattern, unusually long stops, or detachments / attachments in locations not often undertaken.
