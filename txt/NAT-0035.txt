 For Freight Operators –

                             FOUR CHARACTER TRAIN IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM

 1) GENERAL
The first four characters of the train ID number above each column in the timetable
provide the following information :

The first figure indicates the classification of the train. The
second character can indicate the destination area.
The third and fourth figures represent the individual number of the train.


 The remaining fifth and sixth character(s) are used for timetable production purposes only and
 should be disregarded.

2) Freight Headcode Designations –

For inter-regional headcodes, the 2nd character designates destination region (local acceptions can
apply by agreement with Route Operations). Please see table below –

If a service stays within a region, then another letter will be used to indictate the destination, or in
some cases, the route – these can be found in the Route Timetable Planning Rules.

A map of inter-regional areas can be found in Appendix H.
