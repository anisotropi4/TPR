Pinhoe
Planning note
A train that is required to depart Pinhoe Platform 1 in the Up direction and shunt behind Signal EJ1 prevents a
train in the Down direction from being signalled beyond Honiton station (SE4807 or SE4809).
Therefore, any Down direction trains must be planned to depart Honiton no less than 1 minute after a shunt move
has arrived into Pinhoe Platform 2.
