 1.6.5   A basic junction margin is the sum of 1, 2 and 3 rounded to the next half-minute above to form the
         planning margin.

 1.6.6   If this does not provide a sufficient performance buffer, performance uplift will be added. This will
         be an agreed uplift to the sum of the 1 and 3, before adding 2 (this is fixed) and finally rounding to
         the next half-minute above or below. For example, train 1 takes 73 seconds to clear the relevant
         track circuit after leaving the timing point (1). The signaller takes 9 seconds to reset the route for
         train 2 across the junction (2). In order for train 2 to meet its SRTs, the train takes 62 seconds to
         reach the timing point for the junction (3). Ergo, the margin is (73 + 9 + 62) seconds = 144 seconds,
         + 6 seconds uplift to round up to 150 seconds, with any additional uplift agreed as appropriate.

 1.6.7   Network Rail will seek to model most combinations of stopping and non-stopping trains for
         passenger and freight services as agreed with stakeholders.

1.7 Platform Reoccupation
 1.7.1   The values listed in Section 5.3 of the TPR are Junction Margins and Station Planning Rules.

 1.7.2   Platform Reoccupation is the time between one train departing and a second train arriving at a
         location at the same platform in the same direction or movement authority. This value need not be
         calculated on the least restrictive signal aspect, but the second train in the sequence must be able
         to meet its SRTs.

 1.7.3   In the absence of a specific value for Platform Reoccupation the value may be taken as the
         applicable non-stop Planning Headway, noting however that Planning Headway and Platform
         Reoccupation are not linked.

 1.7.4   Platform Reoccupation is measured separately to station dwell time.

 1.7.5 The calculation of a Platform Reoccupation will be undertaken (in seconds) by either:
   • Time taken for the first train to depart the timing point and its rear clearing the relevant track circuit or
      axle counter; plus
