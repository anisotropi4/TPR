Kings Norton

Planning Note
If pathing time is required between Lifford East Jn and Kings Norton, this is to be shown approaching Lifford East
Jn when the first train is using Platform 4 at Kings Norton. This is because there are no intermediate signals
between Lifford East Jn and Kings Norton.

Station working
To allow EMU shunt moves to take place robustly, trains must not be given a shunt stop at Longbridge when
arriving from Barnt Green on the SL. Services are to be allocated pathing time between the two locations or a
timed stop at Longbridge Signal 23.

Turnround Allowance                                10 Must have a minimum of 6 minutes after a timed arrival into
                                                   the turnback siding, subject to an overall minimum of 10
                                                   minutes. All crossing movements must be timed.
