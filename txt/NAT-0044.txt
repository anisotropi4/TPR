4 Service Requirements for Network Services, Measurement
  and Railhead Treatment Trains
4.1    Capacity needs to be provided on the network to facilitate Network Rail’s National Delivery Service
       operations for the distribution of materials for engineering work on the network, Network Measurement
       trains and the Seasonal / Railhead treatment trains. The Train Slots shown in the Appendix I tables
       reflect those requirements.

 4.1.1    Network Services and Railhead Treatment Trains are required to run within the leaf fall season to
          mitigate the effects of fallen leaf litter ground into the surface of the rail head by the passage of
          trains. Over a period of time, this ground in leaf litter forms a Teflon-like material that can lead to two
          material safety impacts on the operational railway:

4.1.1.1   Trains slide on this slippery hardened material and can slide past a signal set at danger leading to a
          SPAD (Signal Past at Danger) that can lead to a collision with another train. Trains also slide past
          the stopping boards at stations. Where there is a level crossing at the end of a platform there is a
          risk of a train colliding with pedestrians and road traffic.

4.1.1.2   The material (contamination) can insulate the contact between the surface of the rail and the metal
          of the wheel, which can lead to Wrong Side Track Circuit Failures where a train is in section but not
          detected by the signalling system. An undetected train is not protected by signals and this can lead
          to it colliding with another train.

 4.1.2    To mitigate the safety risk posed by contaminated rail heads Network Rail employ 18 x Multi-
          Purpose Vehicles (MPVs) that are self-propelled consists and 24 x Loco hauled Rail Head
          Treatment Trains (RHTT) that jet wash the rail head, keeping the rail head clean and optimal for the
          correct adhesion values.

 4.1.3    Many treatment trains also deploy adhesion modifiers, a material which is a mixture of sand and
          adhesion gel providing benefit for trains trying to gain traction rather than braking. Heavy freight
          trains benefit from adhesion modifiers when negotiating inclines during autumnal conditions.

 4.1.4    The same MPVs are utilised in winter to deploy anti ice products to the conductor rail to stop it from
          freezing. When the conductor rail freezes the electric multiple trains in the Southeast, Wessex and
          Merseyrail cannot draw the electric current required for traction. This can lead to trains being
          stranded between stations. Not only is this detrimental to train performance, it is also a safety risk
          as many of these trains need to be de-trained, with passengers having to be escorted down the
          track to an area of safety in often cold and slippery conditions.

 4.1.5    Network Rail’s Infrastructure Monitoring fleet collects a variety of asset data, which is listed in the
          table below:
      Datastream                          Purpose
      Trackbed condition                  Improved renewal decision making
      Structure gauge                     Maintain safe running of trains
      Track interval                      Maintain safe running of trains
      Rail profile                        Measures the rail profile, removing manual inspection and
                                          enables prioritisation of rail replacement.
      Track geometry                      Maintain safe running of trains
      Rail flaw and rail depth            Maintain safe running of trains including prevention of rail breaks
      Rail surface crack                  Maintain safe running of trains including prevention of rail breaks
                                          and enables improved decision making
      Track inspection (PLPR) and         Work force safety, efficient delivery of inspection
      S&C Inspection
      Forward facing video (HD)           Enables remote worksite planning, walk outs
      GSM-R and legacy radio survey       Maintains safe running of trains
