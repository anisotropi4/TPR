#Where the first train is an express service timed at 100mph or above, the converging margin here should take

precedence over the headway i.e. no pathing time should be applied to the second train between Woolmer Green
Junction and Welwyn Garden City for the purpose of artificially re-establishing a higher headway value than the
margin given; the general headway of 3 minutes should naturally restore itself by Potters Bar.

Planning Note
Where possible, pathing allowances should not be applied between Woolmer Green and Digswell
