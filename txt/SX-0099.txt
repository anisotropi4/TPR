Sidings
Example, first train departs Three Bridges towards Down Thameslink Sidings at xx.00. Second movement into
Sidings can depart Three Bridges at xx.20. This margin provides an allowance for the first train to use the washer,
reverse in the headshunt and stable. 8 minutes applies if the second train not washing.
All trains arriving at the Down Sidings must be planned with a ‘dot’ stop at Three Bridges station. This is because
the train will be brought to a stand or near stand at signal T273 before receiving a proceed aspect into the sidings.
