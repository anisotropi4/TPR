Platforms 3 to 12 inclusive are islands combining two platforms on each face, with the odd numbers London end
and even numbers at the Penzance end Mid Platform Signals indicate the limits of each platform.

Permissive Working
Permissive working (PP) is allowed on through platform lines 3/-/12 for the purpose of attaching, detaching and
platform sharing.

Classes of train 1, 2, 3 ECS, 5, 9 and 0 are allowed, together with any class of train formed only of MPV vehicles
when operating as a railhead treatment or inspection train.

When a train (the second train) arrives which is due to attach to the rear of another train in a far platform, there
must be enough room for the whole of the second train in the near platform.


The platform lengths shown below in the third column, are the measured lengths of the platforms, and DO NOT
account for the positions of car stop markers, or stand back distances (assume 10m)
