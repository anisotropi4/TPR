      1.8.10 The principle is that dwell times are balanced in isolation. However, historically there have been
             occasions where rounded dwells are balanced against inherent resilience in the SRTs, resulting
             from the SRT rounding process. Where this is perpetuated it must be supported by data that
             demonstrates this capability at the applicable location.

      1.8.11 If the rounding of a station dwell and a SRT is combined, the cumulative value for the planned SRTs
             across the section that the station is in, must be equal to exceed the cumulative value for the
             technical SRTs of that same section by at least the deficit between the measured and planned value
             of the station dwell.

      1.8.12 Any SRT selected to offset a deficient planned dwell must not also be used to offset another SRT or
             dwell.

      1.8.13 When a dwell review is carried out, if it is established that the rounding of a measured dwell is
             balanced with the rounding of an SRT then the dependency between the dwell and the SRT should
             be documented in the relevant Route Timetable Planning Rules.

      1.8.14 If currently a standard dwell value of 45-seconds applies, then the measured values across a
             section should not exceed the rounded values if this is to be perpetuated.

      1.8.15 A best practice guide to this methodology can be found in Appendix J.

      1.8.16 Where no station-specific minimum value is specified a standard value of half a minute will apply.

      1.8.17 Timetable Participants are responsible for ensuring that station dwell times are robust for
             operational usage and takes account of local operational railway characteristics.


1.9 Turnround Times
      1.9.1        The values listed in Section 5.3 of the TPR are Junction Margins and Station Planning Rules.

      1.9.2        Turnround Times are the minimum time required for rolling stock to be prepared on completing one
                   service before it forms the next service.

      1.9.3        Where necessary and appropriate, differential turnround times shall be created for different
                   combinations of:

              •         Time of day
              •         Rolling stock
