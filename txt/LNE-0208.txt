                                       There must not be two consecutive 5 minute turnrounds, and the total of any
                                       two consecutive turnrounds must equal 15 minutes. These values may be
                                       reduced if sufficient pathing time is included in the schedule approaching

Maximum Dwell                          20 Any turnround longer than 20 should have a shunt movement so that
                                       through services can still operate

Planning Note
It is desirable (though not essential) for terminating trains in excess of 3 coaches to shunt via the Down Loop for
Selective Door Opening (SDO) purposes.
