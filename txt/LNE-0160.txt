dimensions are as follows:

Siding 1
Signal SL7821 to convergence with Siding 2 at rear – 214m/33 SLUs
Convergence point with Siding 2 at rear to buffer stop – 65m/10 SLUs

Siding 2
Signal SL7821 to convergence with Siding 1 at rear – 209m/33 SLUs
Convergence point with Siding 1 at rear to buffer stop – 65m/10 SLUs
