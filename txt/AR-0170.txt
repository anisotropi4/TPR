5.4.1 Loop Lengths

The table below shows the maximum length of train that may use each of the loops at the following locations. All
lengths are in SLU (Standard Length Unit – a SLU measures 21 feet) and metres. All lengths are measured from
the signal at the exit to the loop to the block joint in rear unless started otherwise. All lengths quoted exclude
allowance for locomotives or stand back unless stated otherwise. Check Sectional Appendix for locations where
standage is not quoted.
