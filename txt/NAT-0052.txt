7 Access Impact Matrix
7.1 Introduction
 7.1.1    This section describes the introduction of the Access Impact process to be followed to enable
          agreement between Network Rail and Timetable Participants for delivering Capacity Study requests
          relating to the Engineering Access Statement, new or amended possessions requested by Draft
          Period Possession Plan (TW30) and new or amended possessions requested after publication of
          the Confirmed Period Possession Plan (TW26).

 7.1.2    The Access Impact Matrix was created by Network Rail and Crosscountry to jointly resolve Access
          dispute TTP773. The Access Impact Matrix grades Capacity Studies by severity. Operators will
          grade their Capacity Study requests from the Engineering Access Statement or new/amended
          possessions by DPPP on their Operator Response Sheet.

 7.1.3    Network Rail can challenge the grading and a revised or the original grading should be agreed by all
          parties. Network Rail and the relevant Timetable Participants will jointly agree a delivery date for the
          requested Capacity Study. Extensions to the delivery date of the requested Capacity Study will
          need to be agreed by Network Rail and the relevant Timetable Participants.
