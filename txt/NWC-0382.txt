Planning Note
Down trains exceeding 400 feet (19SLUs) from the Down Newcastle line, standing at CE404 signal will stand foul
of Petteril Bridge Jn and prevent trains accessing the Settle and Carlisle line. Therefore, junction margins must be
applied at Petteril Bridge Jn based on the train’s departure time from CE404 signal.
