Berthing is permitted in platforms 1, 2 and 3 subject to operational and safety restrictions relating to berthing on
running lines.
No more than two platforms can be used for berthing trains at Three Bridges at any one time to ensure that one
platform is always kept clear. When berthing is planned in two platforms at the same time, platform 2 must be kept
clear as this is bi-directional to / from all routes including Three Bridges Up Thameslink Depot
