#Where the first train is an express service timed at 100mph or above, the converging margin here should take

precedence over the headway i.e. no pathing time should be applied to the second train between Digswell and
Woolmer Green Junction for the purpose of artificially re-establishing a higher headway value than the margin
given; the headway of 3 minutes should naturally restore itself once the appropriate acceleration allowances are
added to the schedule of the second train

Junction Margins – Up direction
First Movement                             Second Movement                            Margin

Up Main to Up Slow passenger               Up Main to Up Fast timed at 100mph or      2½
                                           above

Planning Notes
No timing allowances should be applied between Welwyn North and Digswell in the Up direction, for any trains
timed at both, as there are no intermediate signals.

Where possible, pathing allowances should not be applied between Digswell and Woolmer Green Junction


Welwyn North

Station Working
For trains booked to call at Welwyn North a public/working differential (up to a maximum value of 3 minutes) equal
to any pathing time approaching Digswell (down) and Woolmer Green (up) is to be applied
