5.3 Junction Margins and Station Planning Rules
Line of route
The definition for Junction Margins and Station Planning Rules is listed in Section 6.6, 6.7 and 6.8 of the
National TPRs.

All times shown are in minutes. Where adjustments to sectional running times are shown, the value must
be added to the normal SRTs shown in B Plan. Negative adjustments are specially identified.

Minimum station allowances are the minimum practical for the particular type of stock. These are shown
with exceptions being listed by line of route where applicable.

Light engine movements, postal and test trains are to be treated as passenger trains when applying
margins or allowances where there is a passenger/freight differential.
