5.2.2 General Capacity Constraints
The standard headway as shown in 5.2.1 is defined as the minimum planned interval between trains at their closest
point in any route section as shown. Assumptions as to the capacity of any particular route section should not be
made solely by the information contained within this sub-section.

Network Rail will expect operators to allow greater margins between trains, where possible, in order that the finished
timetable is robust.

If trains are deliberately timed to close up on a preceding train, additional allowances must be inserted.

In the interests of a more robust timetable and performance, it is intended that bids from operators for additional
services over certain lines and junctions which have minimal spare capacity will be limited for both permanent and
amended train working, with the following exceptions:

a) Where usage already exceeds the capacity limit, operators will be permitted to retain existing paths but will be
   encouraged to move trains away from the critical period or route section where there are acceptable
   customer/cost considerations. If an operator relinquishes a path in the critical period, other operators would not
   be able to re-occupy the path.
b) If an operator wishes to bid for an additional train/s in the critical period or over the critical route section, that
   request will be tabled for discussion. Normally, additional bids that breach the capacity limit will not be accepted
   but in exceptional circumstances may be accepted subject to all parties affected acknowledging and accepting
   the performance risks.


Where single line working is to operate or trains are to be routed to run on a line other than that normally planned for
them, constraints on capacity will apply – see Engineering Access Statement.

The following special capacity and timing restrictions apply in addition to the constraints stated elsewhere in this
document:
