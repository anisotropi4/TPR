Copenhagen Junction

Note: Trains in the Down direction on the North London Incline (NLI) should not normally be shown to stop at
Copenhagen Junction. Down trains required to stop on the NLI to wait a path over Copenhagen Jn should be
timed to stop at York Way North Jn unless they exceed 630 metres in length. Only trains in excess of 630 metres
in length should be timed to stop at Copenhagen Jn. In those circumstances due to signalling constraints the
following applies: A Down train on the NLI planned to stop at Copenhagen Jn must arrive a minimum of 5 minutes
before the passage of any train on the Down Slow
