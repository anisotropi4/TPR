6 Timetabling Considerations
6.1 Advertised and Working Times
    It is not permissible for trains to be specified to be advertised to arrive before or depart after the booked
    times stated in the working timetable (WTT).

    It is permissible for trains to be specified to be advertised to depart before the booked times stated in the
    working timetable in the following circumstances;

    (i) Where the WTT departure time is delayed to achieve the required headway behind a preceding train or
        margin following a conflicting move.

    (ii) As an aid to punctual departure where this practice has been agreed between the Train Operator and
         Network Rail.

    By agreement between the Train Operator and Network Rail, trains may be specified to be advertised to
    arrive after the booked times stated in the WTT. This agreement is used instead of engineering/performance
    allowances.


6.2 Timing of Light Locomotives
    It is a general principle that all light locomotive movements will be timed. Any exceptions to this must be
    agreed by the appropriate Operational Planning Specialist.


6.3 Two–Track Timetable Railway
    See Engineering Access Statement EA1010 & EA1011 Section 4 – Standard Possession Opportunities for
    details.
