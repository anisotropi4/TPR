Haltwhistle

Restrictions:
    • A train using the crossover west of Haltwhistle will prevent a Down train arriving or standing in the Down
         platform due to signalling overlap
Note:
Signalling in the Up direction will allow a train to proceed past Haltwhistle to signal HW102, whilst waiting for a
previous train to clear the section. A further train can pass Low Row 2 minutes after the train passes Haltwhistle
