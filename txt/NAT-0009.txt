Diagram B (3-aspect signalling)




Technical Headway at Signal GPL66 (above right) is the time elapse between the front of the first train
passing GPL66 (showing a green aspect) and its rear clearing the overlap of GP6144 (above left), this being
the point at which GPL66 would be able to show a green aspect again. Again, to this must be added the
system reset time and the sighting time for the second train to see GPL66 at green.

Hence if the first train were able to maintain 70mph through the section and its length were 120m, the
calculations undertaken would be:

Section (3-Aspect)                    Distance/length (Metres)
Distance GPL66 to GP6146              1482
Distance GP6146 to GP6144             1248
Overlap of GP6144                     222
Train length                          120
Total                                 3072

For this example, system reset time is 4 seconds, and sighting time is 9 seconds.

3072m at 70mph takes 98s, so adding 4s and 9s this would give a Technical Headway of 111s in this
example. Similarly a 350m-long train that could maintain 40mph though the section would alter the
calculation to: (1482+1248+222+350)m at 40mph – 185s.. Adding 4s and 9s gives a Technical Headway of
198s in this case.


Diagram C (2-aspect signalling)




Technical Headway at Signal GPU105 (above centre-right) is the time elapse between the front of the first
train passing GPU105 (showing a green aspect) and its rear clearing the overlap of GPL103 (above left), this
being the point at which GPU105 would be able to show a green aspect again. Again, the system reset time
and sighting time must be added. In this instance, however, unlike the 4-aspect and 3-aspect scenarios
above, in order for the second train not to see restrictive aspects, it must see GPU105R (above right) at
green.

So if the first train were to maintain 40mph through the section and its length were 120m, the calculations
undertaken would be:

Section (2-Aspect)                    Distance/length (Metres)
Distance GPU105 to GPU103             2222
Overlap of GPU103                     251
Train length                          120
Total                                 2593
