It is not possible to add pathing time in the up direction between Southall and Southall East Jn to trains timed ML,
DML or GL as there are no intermediate signals. Pathing time must be added approaching Southall, or in the case
of trains timed GL, with extended dwell time at Southall

For Southall West Jn, the correct Junction Margin to be applied is to be based on the slowest set of
crossovers which the first train will travel over.

*Trains running Up Main or Up the Down Main cannot arrive or pass Southall whilst a conflicting crossing
move is taking place at Southall East Junction
Trains running Up Relief can arrive at Southall whilst a conflicting move is taking place at Southall East
Junction (but cannot depart the station)
