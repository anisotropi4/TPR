Planning Notes
A train cannot pass Landor Street Jn (and stand at SY88 signal) when headed toward St. Andrew’s Jn, if a train is
occupying the Up Camp Hill Curve – due to St. Andrew’s Jn being in the overlap of SY88 signal.
Trains standing at signal LL4772 signal on the Up St. Andrew’s that are longer than 454 meters/71SLUs (exclusive
of stand-back allowance) will foul St. Andrew’s Jn. Therefore, junction margins at St. Andrew’s Jn must be based
on trains’ departure time at Landor Street Jn if over length.

Planning Constraint when routed to Lifford West Jn via Lifford Curve MD580
Due to the signalling constraints, a train routed along the Down Lifford Curve cannot be brought to a stand at
Lifford West Jn SY45 signal and must therefore be held on the Down Camp Hill at Lifford East Jn.
