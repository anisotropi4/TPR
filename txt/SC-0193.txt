Loop Length Restriction/Operating Instructions
Trains using Platform 1 must not exceed 307 metres/48 SLU; trains using Up Loop (Platform 2) must not exceed
358 metres / 56 SLU. A train exceeding these lengths can pass (i.e. not stop) another train subject to the above
margins.
Stopping trains normally use the Down platform, except when passing/being passed by a Down service.
Up trains may ‘overtake’ another Up train, the train being overtaken standing at the Up platform, the overtaking
train stopping at or passing through the Down platform.
