Limits of the 25 kV AC and 750V DC electrification systems are contained in Table A of the Sectional Appendix to the
Working Timetables, issued by, Network Rail. Refer to Table A for the given location to identify the type of
electrification that applies.

3.2 Electrification Supply Restrictions
Under normal conditions, the electrification power supplies will not place any restrictions on the use of approved
