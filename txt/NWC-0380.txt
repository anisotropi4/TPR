Arcow Quarry

Planning Restriction
In the Down direction, Arcow Quarry Ground Frame (GF) does not split up the section Settle Jn to Horton-in-
Ribblesdale; therefore:

When a train for Arcow Quarry arrives at Arcow Quarry GF, the minimum interval to be allowed before the next
Down train passes Settle Jn is 12 minutes. This is to allow sufficient time for the train at the GF to clear the
mainline and for the GF to be given back to the signaller at Settle Jn.

Once a train has departed/passed Horton-in-Ribblesdale, the next train can depart/pass Arcow Quarry GF 2
minutes later.

Operating Restriction
Movements to and from Arcow Quarry are only permitted between 0730 and 1730 Monday-Friday.

Ribblehead Quarry
