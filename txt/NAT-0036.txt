TIMING INFORMATION IN WORKING TIMETABLES

  The timing load description depicts the particular combination of trailing weight and traction type used for timing
  the train. The timing load used for any particular train is separate from and does not override the maximum load
  applicable for the route and traction concerned as published by Railtrack.
  To avoid excessively large numbers of different timing loads a banded approach has been adopted for loads in
  regular use, with steps approximately every 200 tonnes. In some cases the Sectional Running Times (SRTs) may
  be common to two or more timing load bands pending review of the data used to determine the timings.
  The descriptions used reflect the limitation of 8 characters imposed by train planning systems. the following three
  formats are currently used for freight timing load descriptions;

  1.   Diesel hauled class 6, 7 and 8 trains (other than class 60 hauled - see below) without specifying
       a particular traction class. The maximum trailing weight on which the timing is based can be
       determined by reference to Timing Reference Matrix.
