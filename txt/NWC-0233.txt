Tyseley LMD

Operating Restriction for Departures
ECS following each other in the same direction must be planned to depart a minimum of 5 minutes apart.
However, trains can be planned to pass Small Heath South Junction or Tyseley South Junction a minimum of 3
minutes (headway) apart. Pathing time may therefore be used approaching Small Heath South Junction or
Tyseley South Junction if required.

There is no restriction for ECS departing Tyseley Depot in opposite directions.
