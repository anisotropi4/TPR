Planning note
All 80X services to/from LN206 will require a minimum 1½ minute stop in the station for power changeover purposes in
either direction. Where a station dwell already exists, there is sufficient timing within to undertake the power
changeover. All non-stop & ECS services will still require this 1½ mins stop, and it should be denoted an OP stop.
