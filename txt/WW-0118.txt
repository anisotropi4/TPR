    •   On the relief lines in either direction
    •   When running bi-directionally at Hayes & Harlington, or,
    •   When using 387/90 or 387/100 timing loads

Signalling Limitations
It is not possible to add pathing time to trains timed at Hayes and Harlington between Heathrow Airport Jn and
Hayes and Harlington (both directions) as there are no intermediate signals.

Where the leading train calls at Hayes and Harlington, the headway margin is offset, applying between departure
of the leading train from Hayes and Harlington and following train at Heathrow Airport Jn, as yellow signals will be
shown at Heathrow Airport Jn till Hayes and Harlington is clear.

Where a train is planned from Heathrow Airport to run ahead of a train from Slough direction and both booked via
ML, any pathing should be applied to the second train approaching Heathrow Airport Jn and not at Stockley Jn.
This is due to ARS requirements.

Planning Restrictions
Up trains routed to West Drayton ARC Terminal should arrive in Dawley Up Goods Loop before propelling into the
terminal.

Down Trains routed to West Drayton ARC Terminal must run via the URL from Hayes And Harlington to Dawley Up
Goods Loop. They must then complete a run round in Dawley Loop before propelling into the terminal.
Consideration should be given to capacity on the URL to allow the run round move to take place. Alternatively, trains
can run beyond Dawley UGL, run round and approach in the Up Direction.
