Malvern Wells

Capacity Constraints
i) If there is an Up train in the section between Ledbury and Malvern Wells a Down train cannot arrive at/or pass
Malvern Wells until 2 minutes after the Up train has passed Malvern Wells;

ii) ECS movements from the direction of Great Malvern, that are to reverse at Malvern Wells, should arrive no later
than 2 minutes before the arrival of an Up train at Ledbury;

iii) An ECS movement reversing at Malvern Wells can depart from Malvern Wells towards Newlands East L.C.
Signal Box with an Up train in the section between Ledbury and Malvern Wells;

iv) ECS movements towards Great Malvern, that have reversed at Malvern Wells must not arrive Great Malvern
until 3 mins after the previous train has passed Newlands East Signal Box. It is permitted to place pathing time
between Malvern Wells and Great Malvern; MW5 signal protects the AB section. This principle can also be applied
to an Up train from Ledbury following a preceding train towards Newlands East, provided the second train has {1}
inserted approaching Malvern Wells for Restrictive signalling aspects.

v) A 9/10 car class 80x formation booked to reverse at Malvern Wells MUST do so via the single line section and
therefore requires the section to Ledbury to be CLEAR and is subject to note ii).
