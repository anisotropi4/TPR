train standing in platform 2 or platform 4 and cannot cross to platform 3 whilst there is a train in platform 4.
A train cannot enter platform 3 from down Bristol line in the down direction (down Filton relief) whilst there is a train
standing in platform 2 (up Filton main) which is running towards patchway or Filton chord.
