Operational Notes:

Up Side Platform (Platform 1) is preferred for stopping services for disabled access where possible.

It is not possible for 2 trains to pass here where they both exceed the maximum length from the standage behind
the signals:

Platform 1 (Up Train) 175 metres
Platform 1 (Down Train) 180 metres
Platform 2 (Down Train) 175 metres
Platform 2 (Up Train) 175 metres

Total standage between signals SJP248 and SJP253 (platform 1) and between SJP250 and SJP251 (platform 2)
is 105m

Total standage in the down direction at signals SJP251 and SJP253 is 226m
Total standage in the up direction at signals SJP248 and SJP250 is 203m

In all platforming scenarios the overlength train must be planned to depart first
