Up Siding               4*     train held at EDH6 signal
Chartham Siding         8      No EMU to be stabled due to partial electrification and risk of gapping
* anything longer a 4 car needs to be held back at EDH25 signal on the Down Main as the back end will foul EDH2
points meaning no movements in either direction. This movement can only be done if there is no Up train
scheduled, or once a train has passed EDH36 signal and its overlap has dropped out.
