5.2.2 General Capacity Constraints
Where single line working is to operate or trains are to be routed to run on a line other than that normally
planned for them, constraints on capacity will apply – see Engineering Access Statement.

The following special capacity and timing restrictions apply in addition to the constraints stated elsewhere
in this document:

 hour A reserve performance pathway is to apply after six successive moves on the minimum headway or after 20
 minutes (whichever occurs first) to ensure a robust train plan

 hour in each direction.


 MD306 BIRMINGHAM NEW STREET TO ASHCHURCH (EXCLUSIVE)
 Between Birmingham New Street and Kings Norton and v.v., the total number of trains is not to exceed 17 trains
