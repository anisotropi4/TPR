Dwell Time
All services (Up morning peak        1
only)

Length Restrictions
A train exceeding 205m/32SLU in length will foul 911 points when standing at TL300 on the Up Hither Green
Departure Road
Therefore, junction margins must be based on train’s departure time at Hither Green

Planning Note
Trains may only be planned to call at Platform 1 during times of engineering work or other circumstances agreed
in advance with the TOC. This is due to station staff needing to be present to unlock the anti-tresspass gates
