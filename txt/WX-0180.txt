6 Timetabling Considerations
6.1 Advertised and Working Times
It is not permissible for trains to be specified to be advertised to arrive before or depart after the booked times stated
in the working timetable (WTT).

It is permissible for trains to be specified to be advertised to depart before the booked times stated in the working
timetable in the following circumstances;

(i) Where the WTT departure time is delayed to achieve the required headway behind a preceding train or margin
    following a conflicting move.

(ii) As an aid to punctual departure where this practice has been agreed between the Train Operator and Network
     Rail.

By agreement between the Train Operator and Network Rail, trains may be specified to be advertised to arrive after
the booked times stated in the WTT. This agreement is used instead of engineering/performance allowances.

 All SX trains arriving at Waterloo between 0700       Advertised to arrive 2 minutes

                                                       severed. Such instances must be
                                                       agreed by the service specifierâ€™s
                                                       performance manager.
 Other trains may be advertised to depart earlier                                           In order to maintain
 or later at the discretion of the service specifier                                        standard departure patterns


6.2 Timing of Light Locomotives
It is a general principle that all light locomotive movements will be timed. Any exceptions to this must be agreed by
the appropriate Operational Planning Manager.

6.3 Two-Track Timetable Railway
