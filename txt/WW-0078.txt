5.1.4 Timing of Trains Consisting of Passenger Vehicles on Goods Lines
The sectional running timings quoted for trains consisting of passenger vehicles on Goods Lines reflect the speeds
shown in the relevant Table ‘A’ of the appropriate Sectional Appendix. They do not constitute an authority to time
trains conveying passengers on a Goods Lines. Nor do they reflect the permitted speeds at which a train conveying
passengers can proceed. Network Rail will offer the sectional running times for trains conveying passengers on a
Goods Line on a train–by–train basis. For those times please apply to Capacity Planning.

Operations Publications publish the authority to allow the planned operation of trains conveying passengers on
Goods Lines. Before Operations Publications can grant authority they require confirmation that the track is fit for
purpose and that there is a safe method of operation. Therefore Capacity Planning must apply to the relevant Track
Engineer and Operations Manager for confirmation of these requirements in writing. Capacity Planning must pass
these responses to Operations Publications. Capacity Planning is responsible for advising Operations Publications of
the requirement to operate a passenger train on a Goods Line at least 8 weeks before the day of operation.
