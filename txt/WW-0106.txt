Junction Margin – GW routes
Allowances are shown in a matrix giving the time required for the second train to cross after the first train using a
junction on a conflicting move has passed, unless otherwise stated in 5.3. Elements used in the construction of the
margin are signal spacing, junction resetting time and speed of the junction turnout (see table below).
Note: if first train is a pass/arrive and second train a conflicting departure, 1 minute may be applied as per platform
end margins (when trains are travelling in opposite directions).
