4.6 Engineers Trains Restrictions
Some On Track Machines (OTMs) do not reliably activate track circuits. These OTMs must use one of the
following special reporting numbers 6Z09, 7Z09 or 8Z09*. Because these OTMs do not reliably activate track
circuits it is not possible to apply the headways and junction margins as outlined in the Timetable Planning Rules
consistently and it is therefore not possible for Operational Planning to provide timings for these movements.

4.7 Driver Only Operation Limits
Driver only operation (DOO) of passenger trains is permitted within the East Anglia Region as listed. Driver only
operation of non-passenger trains – DOO (NP) – is, however, permitted on all routes.

When special trains are required to run DOO (NP) over the following routes, it must be ascertained that competent
staff are available to deal with these trains at the forwarding and receiving terminals, yards, sidings etc., or where
locomotive changes take place en route. Furthermore, signal boxes are to be advised of these additional DOO
(NP) services, with particular reference to Empty Coaching Stock (ECS) trains.

In the table below, the following abbreviations apply:

Pass – Passenger trains with power operated sliding doors
ECS Slam – Empty Coaching Stock with slam doors
ECS Slide – Empty Coaching Stock with power operated sliding doors
NA – Not authorised
P – Permitted
# - Permitted for short notice movements when all other DOO (NP) conditions are fulfilled and all doors are locked
before departure. Authorisation must be obtained from Network Rail Operations Control before this can be applied.
