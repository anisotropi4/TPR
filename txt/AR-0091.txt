Gidea Park Stabling Lines & Gidea Park Shunt Spur

Restrictions
Simultaneous arrivals at the Stabling Lines are not possible. This includes both the Stabling Lines and Shunt
Spur, e.g. if one arrival is at the London End and one arrival is at the Shunt Spur at the Country End. This is due
to the signal overlaps on the Stabling Lines extending into the Shunt Spur at the Country End and overrun spur at
the London End. Similarly, a simultaneous departure from the Shunt Spur and arrival at the Stabling Lines is not
possible.
