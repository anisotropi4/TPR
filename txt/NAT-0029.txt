Appendix E - Definition of Access Proposal / Revised Access
Proposal
2.20 General Principles
  2.20.1 Part D of the Network Code defines an Access Proposal as when a Timetable Participant wishes to
         exercise any Firm Rights and/or Contingent Rights and/or any expectation of rights to obtain Train
         Slots in respect of the relevant Timetable Period, where those rights were not exercised to obtain
         Train Slots in the Prior Working Timetable; and/or (b) it wishes to make changes to any Train Slot in
         the Prior Working Timetable; and/or (c) it wishes to set out its requirements in response to a
         notification by Network Rail under Condition D2.4.6.



2.21 Train Operator Variation
  2.21.1 From D-26 and during the relevant Timetable Period, Timetable Participants may wish to vary either
         the New Working Timetable, if it is before the Timetable Change Date, or otherwise the Working
         Timetable on an ad hoc basis by adding an additional Train Slot on one or more occasions, amending
         the detail of one or more Train Slots, removing one or more Train Slots.
