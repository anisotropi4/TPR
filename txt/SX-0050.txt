If there is doubt about a signal box’s opening hours check with the appropriate Network Rail Operations Manager.

When the routes shown are required for services diverted under the Engineering Access Statement, opening hours
will be increased as necessary on a temporary basis.

Signal boxes equipped to be switched-out during a route’s opening hours are shown within the routes concerned.
