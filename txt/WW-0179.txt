                                         and Southcote Jn have been

Signalling Limitations
It is not possible to add pathing time between Reading West and Oxford Road Jn because the protecting signal for
Oxford Road Jn is at the east platform end at Reading West. Increased dwell time should be added at Reading
West where it would otherwise be necessary to add pathing time.
It is not possible to add pathing time between Oxford Road Jn and Reading West because there are no
intermediate signals. Additional Pathing time should be added approaching Oxford Road Jn instead.
